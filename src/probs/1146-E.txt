E. Hot is Coldtime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given an array of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$.You will perform $$$q$$$ operations. In the $$$i$$$-th operation, you have a symbol $$$s_i$$$ which is either "<" or ">" and a number $$$x_i$$$.You make a new array $$$b$$$ such that $$$b_j = -a_j$$$ if $$$a_j s_i x_i$$$ and $$$b_j = a_j$$$ otherwise (i.e. if $$$s_i$$$ is '>', then all $$$a_j > x_i$$$ will be flipped). After doing all these replacements, $$$a$$$ is set to be $$$b$$$.You want to know what your final array looks like after all operations.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n,q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n,q \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of integers and the number of queries.The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^5 \leq a_i \leq 10^5$$$) — the numbers.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains a character and an integer $$$s_i, x_i$$$. ($$$s_i \in \{<, >\}, -10^5 \leq x_i \leq 10^5$$$) – the queries.OutputPrint $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$$$ representing the array after all operations.     bitmasks      data structures      divide and conquer      implementation      *2400
