D. Antstime 3  768 There is a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices. There are also $$$m$$$ ants living on it. Each ant has its own color. The $$$i$$$-th ant has two favorite pairs of vertices: ($$$a_i, b_i$$$) and ($$$c_i, d_i$$$). You need to tell if it is possible to paint the edges of the tree in $$$m$$$ colors so that every ant will be able to walk between vertices from one of its favorite pairs using only edges of his color; if it is possible, you need to print which pair every ant should use.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices.Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq n$$$), meaning that there is an edge between vertices $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$.The next line contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq m \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of ants.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains four integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$, $$$c_i$$$, and $$$d_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i \leq n$$$, $$$a_i \neq b_i, c_i \neq d_i$$$), meaning that pairs ($$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$) and ($$$c_i$$$, $$$d_i$$$) are favorite for the $$$i$$$-th ant.OutputPrint "NO" (without quotes) if the wanted painting is impossible.Otherwise, print "YES" (without quotes). Print $$$m$$$ lines. On the $$$i$$$-th line, print $$$1$$$ if the $$$i$$$-th ant will use the first pair and $$$2$$$ otherwise. If there are multiple answers, print any.     2-sat      data structures      trees      *3200
