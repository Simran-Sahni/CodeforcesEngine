C. Generate GHZ statetime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given N qubits (1 ≤ N ≤ 8) in zero state . Your task is to create Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state on them:Note that for N = 1 and N = 2 GHZ state becomes states  and  from the previous tasks, respectively.InputYou have to implement an operation which takes an array of N qubits as an input and has no output. The "output" of your solution is the state in which it left the input qubits.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : ()    {        body        {            // your code here        }    }     *special problem      *1400
