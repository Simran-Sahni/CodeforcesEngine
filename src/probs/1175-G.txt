G. Yet Another Partiton Problemtime 5  512 You are given array $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$. You need to split it into $$$k$$$ subsegments (so every element is included in exactly one subsegment).The weight of a subsegment $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r$$$ is equal to $$$(r - l + 1) \cdot \max\limits_{l \le i \le r}(a_i)$$$. The weight of a partition is a total weight of all its segments.Find the partition of minimal weight.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^4$$$, $$$1 \le k \le \min(100, n)$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the number of subsegments in the partition.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.OutputPrint single integer — the minimal weight among all possible partitions.     data structures      divide and conquer      dp      geometry      two pointers      *3000
