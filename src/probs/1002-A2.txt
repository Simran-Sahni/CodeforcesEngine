A2. Generate superposition of zero state and a basis statetime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given N qubits (1 ≤ N ≤ 8) in zero state . You are also given a bitstring bits which describes a non-zero basis state on N qubits .Your task is to generate a state which is an equal superposition of  and the given basis state:You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs: an array of qubits qs, an arrays of boolean values bits representing the basis state . This array will have the same length as the array of qubits. The first element of this array bits[0] will be true.The operation doesn't have an output; its "output" is the state in which it leaves the qubits.An array of boolean values represents a basis state as follows: the i-th element of the array is true if the i-th qubit is in state , and false if it is in state . For example, array [true; false] describes 2-qubit state , and in this case the resulting state should be .Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[], bits : Bool[]) : ()    {        body        {            // your code here        }    }     *1300
