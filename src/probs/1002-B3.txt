B3. Distinguish four 2-qubit statestime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given 2 qubits which are guaranteed to be in one of the four orthogonal states:    Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which state it was and to return the index of that state (0 for , 1 for  etc.). The state of the qubits after the operations does not matter.You have to implement an operation which takes an array of 2 qubits as an input and returns an integer. Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : Int    {        body        {            // your code here        }    }     *1600
