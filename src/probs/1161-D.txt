D. Palindrome XORtime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of characters "1", "0", and "?". The first character of $$$s$$$ is guaranteed to be "1". Let $$$m$$$ be the number of characters in $$$s$$$.Count the number of ways we can choose a pair of integers $$$a, b$$$ that satisfies the following:   $$$1 \leq a < b < 2^m$$$  When written without leading zeros, the base-2 representations of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are both palindromes.  The base-2 representation of bitwise XOR of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ matches the pattern $$$s$$$. We say that $$$t$$$ matches $$$s$$$ if the lengths of $$$t$$$ and $$$s$$$ are the same and for every $$$i$$$, the $$$i$$$-th character of $$$t$$$ is equal to the $$$i$$$-th character of $$$s$$$, or the $$$i$$$-th character of $$$s$$$ is "?". Compute this count modulo $$$998244353$$$. InputThe first line contains a single string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \leq |s| \leq 1\,000$$$). $$$s$$$ consists only of characters "1", "0" and "?". It is guaranteed that the first character of $$$s$$$ is a "1".OutputPrint a single integer, the count of pairs that satisfy the conditions modulo $$$998244353$$$.     graphs      implementation      *2400
