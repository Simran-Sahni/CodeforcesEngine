F. One Occurrencetime 3  768 You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers, and $$$q$$$ queries to it. $$$i$$$-th query is denoted by two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$. For each query, you have to find any integer that occurs exactly once in the subarray of $$$a$$$ from index $$$l_i$$$ to index $$$r_i$$$ (a subarray is a contiguous subsegment of an array). For example, if $$$a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 4]$$$, then for query $$$(l_i = 2, r_i = 6)$$$ the subarray we are interested in is $$$[1, 2, 3, 2, 4]$$$, and possible answers are $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$; for query $$$(l_i = 1, r_i = 2)$$$ the subarray we are interested in is $$$[1, 1]$$$, and there is no such element that occurs exactly once.Can you answer all of the queries?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$).The third line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$).Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, $$$i$$$-th line containing two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ representing $$$i$$$-th query ($$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$$$).OutputAnswer the queries as follows:If there is no integer such that it occurs in the subarray from index $$$l_i$$$ to index $$$r_i$$$ exactly once, print $$$0$$$. Otherwise print any such integer     data structures      divide and conquer      *2400
