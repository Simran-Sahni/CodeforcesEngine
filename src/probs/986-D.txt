D. Perfect Encodingtime 2  256 You are working as an analyst in a company working on a new system for big data storage. This system will store $$$n$$$ different objects. Each object should have a unique ID.To create the system, you choose the parameters of the system — integers $$$m \ge 1$$$ and $$$b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots, b_{m}$$$. With these parameters an ID of some object in the system is an array of integers $$$[a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{m}]$$$ where $$$1 \le a_{i} \le b_{i}$$$ holds for every $$$1 \le i \le m$$$.Developers say that production costs are proportional to $$$\sum_{i=1}^{m} b_{i}$$$. You are asked to choose parameters $$$m$$$ and $$$b_{i}$$$ so that the system will be able to assign unique IDs to $$$n$$$ different objects and production costs are minimized. Note that you don't have to use all available IDs.InputIn the only line of input there is one positive integer $$$n$$$. The length of the decimal representation of $$$n$$$ is no greater than $$$1.5 \cdot 10^{6}$$$. The integer does not contain leading zeros.OutputPrint one number — minimal value of $$$\sum_{i=1}^{m} b_{i}$$$.     fft      math      *3100
