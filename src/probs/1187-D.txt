D. Subarray Sortingtime 2  256 You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ and an array $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$$$.For one operation you can sort in non-decreasing order any subarray $$$a[l \dots r]$$$ of the array $$$a$$$.For example, if $$$a = [4, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1]$$$ and you choose subbarray $$$a[2 \dots 5]$$$, then the array turns into $$$[4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]$$$. You are asked to determine whether it is possible to obtain the array $$$b$$$ by applying this operation any number of times (possibly zero) to the array $$$a$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries.The first line of each query contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$).The second line of each query contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$).The third line of each query contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le n$$$).It is guaranteed that $$$\sum n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$ over all queries in a test.OutputFor each query print YES (in any letter case) if it is possible to obtain an array $$$b$$$ and NO (in any letter case) otherwise     data structures      sortings      *2400
