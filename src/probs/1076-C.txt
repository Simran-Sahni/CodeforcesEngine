You have to find two non-negative real numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ such that $$$a + b = d$$$ and $$$a \cdot b = d$$$.InputThe first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case contains one integer $$$d$$$ $$$(0 \le d \le 10^3)$$$.OutputFor each test print one line.If there is an answer for the $$$i$$$-th test, print "Y", and then the numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.If there is no answer for the $$$i$$$-th test, print "N".Your answer will be considered correct if $$$|(a + b) - a \cdot b| \le 10^{-6}$$$ and $$$|(a + b) - d| \le 10^{-6}$$$     binary search      math      *1300
