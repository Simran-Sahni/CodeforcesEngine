D. Almost Arithmetic Progressiontime 1 secondmemory 256 Polycarp likes arithmetic progressions. A sequence $$$[a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]$$$ is called an arithmetic progression if for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i < n$$$) the value $$$a_{i+1} - a_i$$$ is the same. For example, the sequences $$$[42]$$$, $$$[5, 5, 5]$$$, $$$[2, 11, 20, 29]$$$ and $$$[3, 2, 1, 0]$$$ are arithmetic progressions, but $$$[1, 0, 1]$$$, $$$[1, 3, 9]$$$ and $$$[2, 3, 1]$$$ are not.It follows from the definition that any sequence of length one or two is an arithmetic progression.Polycarp found some sequence of positive integers $$$[b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n]$$$. He agrees to change each element by at most one. In the other words, for each element there are exactly three options: an element can be decreased by $$$1$$$, an element can be increased by $$$1$$$, an element can be left unchanged.Determine a minimum possible number of elements in $$$b$$$ which can be changed (by exactly one), so that the sequence $$$b$$$ becomes an arithmetic progression, or report that it is impossible.It is possible that the resulting sequence contains element equals $$$0$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \le n \le 100\,000)$$$ — the number of elements in $$$b$$$.The second line contains a sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$$$ $$$(1 \le b_i \le 10^{9})$$$.OutputIf it is impossible to make an arithmetic progression with described operations, print -1. In the other case, print non-negative integer — the minimum number of elements to change to make the given sequence becomes an arithmetic progression. The only allowed operation is to add/to subtract one from an element (can't use operation twice to the same position).     brute force      implementation      math      *1500
