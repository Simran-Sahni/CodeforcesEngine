I. Yet Another String Matching Problemtime 4  256 Suppose you have two strings s and t, and their length is equal. You may perform the following operation any number of times: choose two different characters c1 and c2, and replace every occurence of c1 in both strings with c2. Let's denote the distance between strings s and t as the minimum number of operations required to make these strings equal. For example, if s is abcd and t is ddcb, the distance between them is 2 — we may replace every occurence of a with b, so s becomes bbcd, and then we may replace every occurence of b with d, so both strings become ddcd.You are given two strings S and T. For every substring of S consisting of |T| characters you have to determine the distance between this substring and T.InputThe first line contains the string S, and the second — the string T (1 ≤ |T| ≤ |S| ≤ 125000). Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters from a to f.OutputPrint |S| - |T| + 1 integers. The i-th of these integers must be equal to the distance between the substring of S beginning at i-th index with length |T| and the string T     fft      math      *2200
