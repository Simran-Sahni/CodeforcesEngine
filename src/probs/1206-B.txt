B. Make Product Equal Onetime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given $$$n$$$ numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$. With a cost of one coin you can perform the following operation:Choose one of these numbers and add or subtract $$$1$$$ from it.In particular, we can apply this operation to the same number several times.We want to make the product of all these numbers equal to $$$1$$$, in other words, we want $$$a_1 \cdot a_2$$$ $$$\dots$$$ $$$\cdot a_n = 1$$$. For example, for $$$n = 3$$$ and numbers $$$[1, -3, 0]$$$ we can make product equal to $$$1$$$ in $$$3$$$ coins: add $$$1$$$ to second element, add $$$1$$$ to second element again, subtract $$$1$$$ from third element, so that array becomes $$$[1, -1, -1]$$$. And $$$1\cdot (-1) \cdot (-1) = 1$$$.What is the minimum cost we will have to pay to do that?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the number of numbers.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the numbers.OutputOutput a single number — the minimal number of coins you need to pay to make the product equal to $$$1$$$.     dp      implementation      *900
