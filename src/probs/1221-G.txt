G. Graph And Numberstime 3.5  512 You are given an undirected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges. You have to write a number on each vertex of this graph, each number should be either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. After that, you write a number on each edge equal to the sum of numbers on vertices incident to that edge.You have to choose the numbers you will write on the vertices so that there is at least one edge with $$$0$$$ written on it, at least one edge with $$$1$$$ and at least one edge with $$$2$$$. How many ways are there to do it? Two ways to choose numbers are different if there exists at least one vertex which has different numbers written on it in these two ways.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 40$$$, $$$0 \le m \le \frac{n(n - 1)}{2}$$$) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, each line contains two numbers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \le x_i, y_i \le n$$$, $$$x_i \ne y_i$$$) — the endpoints of the $$$i$$$-th edge. It is guaranteed that each pair of vertices is connected by at most one edge.OutputPrint one integer — the number of ways to write numbers on all vertices so that there exists at least one edge with $$$0$$$ written on it, at least one edge with $$$1$$$ and at least one edge with $$$2$$$.     bitmasks      brute force      combinatorics      dp      meet-in-the-middle      *2900
