F. Consecutive Subsequencetime 2  256 You are given an integer array of length $$$n$$$.You have to choose some subsequence of this array of maximum length such that this subsequence forms a increasing sequence of consecutive integers. In other words the required sequence should be equal to $$$[x, x + 1, \dots, x + k - 1]$$$ for some value $$$x$$$ and length $$$k$$$.Subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array. You can erase any elements, not necessarily going successively. The remaining elements preserve their order. For example, for the array $$$[5, 3, 1, 2, 4]$$$ the following arrays are subsequences: $$$[3]$$$, $$$[5, 3, 1, 2, 4]$$$, $$$[5, 1, 4]$$$, but the array $$$[1, 3]$$$ is not.InputThe first line of the input containing integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of the input containing $$$n$$$ integer numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the array itself.OutputOn the first line print $$$k$$$ — the maximum length of the subsequence of the given array that forms an increasing sequence of consecutive integers.On the second line print the sequence of the indices of the any maximum length subsequence of the given array that forms an increasing sequence of consecutive integers.     dp      *1700
