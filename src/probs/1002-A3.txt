A3. Generate superposition of two basis statestime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given N qubits (1 ≤ N ≤ 8) in zero state . You are also given two bitstrings bits0 and bits1 which describe two different basis states on N qubits  and .Your task is to generate a state which is an equal superposition of the given basis states:You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs: an array of qubits qs, two arrays of Boolean values bits0 and bits1 representing the basis states  and . These arrays will have the same length as the array of qubits. bits0 and bits1 will differ in at least one position.The operation doesn't have an output; its "output" is the state in which it leaves the qubits.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[], bits0 : Bool[], bits1 : Bool[]) : ()    {        body        {            // your code here        }    }     *1500
