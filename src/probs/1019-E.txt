E. Raining seasontime 3  256 By the year 3018, Summer Informatics School has greatly grown. Hotel «Berendeetronik» has been chosen as a location of the school. The camp consists of $$$n$$$ houses with $$$n-1$$$ pathways between them. It is possible to reach every house from each other using the pathways.Everything had been perfect until the rains started. The weather forecast promises that rains will continue for $$$m$$$ days. A special squad of teachers was able to measure that the $$$i$$$-th pathway, connecting houses $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$, before the rain could be passed in $$$b_i$$$ seconds. Unfortunately, the rain erodes the roads, so with every day the time to pass the road will increase by $$$a_i$$$ seconds. In other words, on the $$$t$$$-th (from zero) day after the start of the rain, it will take $$$a_i \cdot t + b_i$$$ seconds to pass through this road.Unfortunately, despite all the efforts of teachers, even in the year 3018 not all the students are in their houses by midnight. As by midnight all students have to go to bed, it is important to find the maximal time between all the pairs of houses for each day, so every student would know the time when he has to run to his house.Find all the maximal times of paths between every pairs of houses after $$$t=0$$$, $$$t=1$$$, ..., $$$t=m-1$$$ days.InputIn the first line you are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ — the number of houses in the camp and the number of raining days ($$$1 \le n \le 100\,000$$$; $$$1 \le m \le 1\,000\,000$$$).In the next $$$n-1$$$ lines you are given the integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$, $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$ — description of pathways ($$$1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$$$; $$$0 \le a_i \le 10^5$$$; $$$0 \le b_i \le 10^9$$$). $$$i$$$-th pathway connects houses $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$, and in day $$$t$$$ requires $$$a_i \cdot t + b_i$$$ seconds to pass through.It is guaranteed that every two houses are connected by a sequence of pathways.OutputPrint $$$m$$$ integers — the lengths of the longest path in the camp after a $$$t=0, t=1, \ldots, t=m-1$$$ days after the start of the rain     data structures      divide and conquer      trees      *3200
