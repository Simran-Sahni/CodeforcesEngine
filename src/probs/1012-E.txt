E. Cycle sorttime 2  256 You are given an array of $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$. You can perform the following operation any number of times: select several distinct indices $$$i_1, i_2, \dots, i_k$$$ ($$$1 \le i_j \le n$$$) and move the number standing at the position $$$i_1$$$ to the position $$$i_2$$$, the number at the position $$$i_2$$$ to the position $$$i_3$$$, ..., the number at the position $$$i_k$$$ to the position $$$i_1$$$. In other words, the operation cyclically shifts elements: $$$i_1 \to i_2 \to \ldots i_k \to i_1$$$.For example, if you have $$$n=4$$$, an array $$$a_1=10, a_2=20, a_3=30, a_4=40$$$, and you choose three indices $$$i_1=2$$$, $$$i_2=1$$$, $$$i_3=4$$$, then the resulting array would become $$$a_1=20, a_2=40, a_3=30, a_4=10$$$.Your goal is to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order with the minimum number of operations. The additional constraint is that the sum of cycle lengths over all operations should be less than or equal to a number $$$s$$$. If it's impossible to sort the array while satisfying that constraint, your solution should report that as well.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 200\,000$$$, $$$0 \leq s \leq 200\,000$$$)—the number of elements in the array and the upper bound on the sum of cycle lengths.The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$—elements of the array ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$).OutputIf it's impossible to sort the array using cycles of total length not exceeding $$$s$$$, print a single number "-1" (quotes for clarity).Otherwise, print a single number $$$q$$$— the minimum number of operations required to sort the array.On the next $$$2 \cdot q$$$ lines print descriptions of operations in the order they are applied to the array. The description of $$$i$$$-th operation begins with a single line containing one integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le n$$$)—the length of the cycle (that is, the number of selected indices). The next line should contain $$$k$$$ distinct integers $$$i_1, i_2, \dots, i_k$$$ ($$$1 \le i_j \le n$$$)—the indices of the cycle.The sum of lengths of these cycles should be less than or equal to $$$s$$$, and the array should be sorted after applying these $$$q$$$ operations.If there are several possible answers with the optimal $$$q$$$, print any of them.     dsu      math      *3100
