B. Segment Occurrencestime 2  256 You are given two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$, both consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.The substring $$$s[l..r]$$$ is the string which is obtained by taking characters $$$s_l, s_{l + 1}, \dots, s_r$$$ without changing the order.Each of the occurrences of string $$$a$$$ in a string $$$b$$$ is a position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le |b| - |a| + 1$$$) such that $$$b[i..i + |a| - 1] = a$$$ ($$$|a|$$$ is the length of string $$$a$$$).You are asked $$$q$$$ queries: for the $$$i$$$-th query you are required to calculate the number of occurrences of string $$$t$$$ in a substring $$$s[l_i..r_i]$$$.InputThe first line contains three integer numbers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 10^3$$$, $$$1 \le q \le 10^5$$$) — the length of string $$$s$$$, the length of string $$$t$$$ and the number of queries, respectively.The second line is a string $$$s$$$ ($$$|s| = n$$$), consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.The third line is a string $$$t$$$ ($$$|t| = m$$$), consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integer numbers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$$$) — the arguments for the $$$i$$$-th query.OutputPrint $$$q$$$ lines — the $$$i$$$-th line should contain the answer to the $$$i$$$-th query, that is the number of occurrences of string $$$t$$$ in a substring $$$s[l_i..r_i]$$$.     brute force      implementation      *1300
