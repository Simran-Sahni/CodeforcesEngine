E. Product Tuplestime 8  128 While roaming the mystic areas of Stonefalls, in order to drop legendary loot, an adventurer was given a quest as follows. He was given an array $$$A = {a_1,a_2,...,a_N }$$$ of length $$$N$$$, and a number $$$K$$$.Define array $$$B$$$ as $$$B(q, A) = $$$ { $$$q-a_1, q-a_2, ..., q-a_N$$$ }. Define function $$$F$$$ as $$$F(B,K)$$$ being sum of products of all $$$K$$$-tuples of elements in array $$$B$$$. For example, if the array $$$B$$$ is $$$[2,3,4,5]$$$, and with $$$K=3$$$, sum of products of all 3-tuples is $$$$$$F(B, 3) = 2*3*4+2*3*5+3*4*5+2*4*5$$$$$$He was then given a number Q, number of queries of two types:   Type 1: Given $$$q$$$, $$$i$$$, and $$$d$$$ calculate $$$F(B(q, A), K)$$$ where we make change to initial array as $$$A[i] = d$$$.  Type 2: Given $$$q$$$, $$$L$$$, $$$R$$$, and $$$d$$$ calculate $$$F(B(q, A), K)$$$ where we make change to initial array as $$$A[i] = A[i] + d$$$ for all $$$i$$$ in range $$$[L, R]$$$ inclusive. All changes are temporarily made to initial array, and don't propagate to following queries. Help the adventurer calculate the answer to a quest, and finally get that loot!InputIn the first two lines, numbers $$$N$$$ ($$$1 \leq N \leq 2*10^4$$$) and $$$K$$$ ($$$1 \leq K \leq N$$$), the length of initial array $$$A$$$, and tuple size, followed by $$$a_1,a_2,a_3,…,a_N$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) , elements of array $$$A$$$, in the next line. Then follows number $$$Q$$$ ($$$Q \leq 10$$$), number of queries. In the next $$$Q$$$ lines come queries of the form:   1 q i d, for type 1,  2 q L R d, for type 2, as explained above ($$$0 \leq q, d \leq 10^9, 1 \leq i,L,R \leq N$$$)OutputPrint $$$Q$$$ lines, the answers to queries, modulo $$$998244353$$$     divide and conquer      fft      *2500
