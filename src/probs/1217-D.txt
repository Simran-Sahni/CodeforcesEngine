D. Coloring Edgestime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given a directed graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ directed edges without self-loops or multiple edges.Let's denote the $$$k$$$-coloring of a digraph as following: you color each edge in one of $$$k$$$ colors. The $$$k$$$-coloring is good if and only if there no cycle formed by edges of same color.Find a good $$$k$$$-coloring of given digraph with minimum possible $$$k$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 5000$$$, $$$1 \le m \le 5000$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the digraph, respectively.Next $$$m$$$ lines contain description of edges — one per line. Each edge is a pair of integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le u, v \le n$$$, $$$u \ne v$$$) — there is directed edge from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ in the graph.It is guaranteed that each ordered pair $$$(u, v)$$$ appears in the list of edges at most once.OutputIn the first line print single integer $$$k$$$ — the number of used colors in a good $$$k$$$-coloring of given graph.In the second line print $$$m$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_m$$$ ($$$1 \le c_i \le k$$$), where $$$c_i$$$ is a color of the $$$i$$$-th edge (in order as they are given in the input).If there are multiple answers print any of them (you still have to minimize $$$k$$$).     constructive algorithms      dfs and similar      graphs      *2100
