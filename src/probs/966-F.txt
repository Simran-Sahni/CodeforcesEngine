F. Parametric Circulationtime 2  256 Vova has recently learned what a circulaton in a graph is. Recall the definition: let $$$G = (V, E)$$$ be a directed graph. A circulation $$$f$$$ is such a collection of non-negative real numbers $$$f_e$$$ ($$$e \in E$$$), that for each vertex $$$v \in V$$$ the following conservation condition holds:$$$$$$\sum\limits_{e \in \delta^{-}(v)} f_e = \sum\limits_{e \in \delta^{+}(v)} f_e$$$$$$where $$$\delta^{+}(v)$$$ is the set of edges that end in the vertex $$$v$$$, and $$$\delta^{-}(v)$$$ is the set of edges that start in the vertex $$$v$$$. In other words, for each vertex the total incoming flow should be equal to the total outcoming flow.Let a $$$lr$$$-circulation be such a circulation $$$f$$$ that for each edge the condition $$$l_e \leq f_e \leq r_e$$$ holds, where $$$l_e$$$ and $$$r_e$$$ for each edge $$$e \in E$$$ are two non-negative real numbers denoting the lower and upper bounds on the value of the circulation on this edge $$$e$$$.Vova can't stop thinking about applications of a new topic. Right now he thinks about the following natural question: let the graph be fixed, and each value $$$l_e$$$ and $$$r_e$$$ be a linear function of a real variable $$$t$$$:$$$$$$l_e(t) = a_e t + b_e$$$$$$ $$$$$$r_e(t) = c_e t + d_e$$$$$$Note that $$$t$$$ is the same for all edges.Let $$$t$$$ be chosen at random from uniform distribution on a segment $$$[0, 1]$$$. What is the probability of existence of $$$lr$$$-circulation in the graph?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 1000$$$, $$$1 \leq m \leq 2000$$$).Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines describes edges of the graph in the format $$$u_e$$$, $$$v_e$$$, $$$a_e$$$, $$$b_e$$$, $$$c_e$$$, $$$d_e$$$ ($$$1 \leq u_e, v_e \leq n$$$, $$$-10^4 \leq a_e, c_e \leq 10^4$$$, $$$0 \leq b_e, d_e \leq 10^4$$$), where $$$u_e$$$ and $$$v_e$$$ are the startpoint and the endpoint of the edge $$$e$$$, and the remaining 4 integers describe the linear functions for the upper and lower bound of circulation.It is guaranteed that for any $$$t \in [0, 1]$$$ and for any edge $$$e \in E$$$ the following condition holds $$$0 \leq l_e(t) \leq r_e(t) \leq 10^4$$$.OutputPrint a single real integer — the probability of existence of $$$lr$$$-circulation in the graph, given that $$$t$$$ is chosen uniformly at random from the segment $$$[0, 1]$$$. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute difference from jury's answer is not greater than $$$10^{-6}$$$     flows      *3100
