C. Permutation Gametime 1 secondmemory 256 After a long day, Alice and Bob decided to play a little game. The game board consists of $$$n$$$ cells in a straight line, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, where each cell contains a number $$$a_i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$. Furthermore, no two cells contain the same number. A token is placed in one of the cells. They take alternating turns of moving the token around the board, with Alice moving first. The current player can move from cell $$$i$$$ to cell $$$j$$$ only if the following two conditions are satisfied:   the number in the new cell $$$j$$$ must be strictly larger than the number in the old cell $$$i$$$ (i.e. $$$a_j > a_i$$$), and  the distance that the token travels during this turn must be a multiple of the number in the old cell (i.e. $$$|i-j|\bmod a_i = 0$$$). Whoever is unable to make a move, loses. For each possible starting position, determine who wins if they both play optimally. It can be shown that the game is always finite, i.e. there always is a winning strategy for one of the players.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the number of numbers.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$). Furthermore, there are no pair of indices $$$i \neq j$$$ such that $$$a_i = a_j$$$.OutputPrint $$$s$$$ — a string of $$$n$$$ characters, where the $$$i$$$-th character represents the outcome of the game if the token is initially placed in the cell $$$i$$$. If Alice wins, then $$$s_i$$$ has to be equal to "A"; otherwise, $$$s_i$$$ has to be equal to "B".      brute force      dp      games      *1600
