F. Lunar New Year and a Recursive Sequencetime 3  256 Lunar New Year is approaching, and Bob received a gift from his friend recently — a recursive sequence! He loves this sequence very much and wants to play with it.Let $$$f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_i, \ldots$$$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers. Bob knows that for $$$i > k$$$, $$$f_i$$$ can be obtained by the following recursive equation:$$$$$$f_i = \left(f_{i - 1} ^ {b_1} \cdot f_{i - 2} ^ {b_2} \cdot \cdots \cdot f_{i - k} ^ {b_k}\right) \bmod p,$$$$$$which in short is$$$$$$f_i = \left(\prod_{j = 1}^{k} f_{i - j}^{b_j}\right) \bmod p,$$$$$$where $$$p = 998\,244\,353$$$ (a widely-used prime), $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_k$$$ are known integer constants, and $$$x \bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder of $$$x$$$ divided by $$$y$$$.Bob lost the values of $$$f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_k$$$, which is extremely troublesome – these are the basis of the sequence! Luckily, Bob remembers the first $$$k - 1$$$ elements of the sequence: $$$f_1 = f_2 = \ldots = f_{k - 1} = 1$$$ and the $$$n$$$-th element: $$$f_n = m$$$. Please find any possible value of $$$f_k$$$. If no solution exists, just tell Bob that it is impossible to recover his favorite sequence, regardless of Bob's sadness.InputThe first line contains a positive integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq k \leq 100$$$), denoting the length of the sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_k$$$.The second line contains $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_k$$$ ($$$1 \leq b_i < p$$$).The third line contains two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$k < n \leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \leq m < p$$$), which implies $$$f_n = m$$$.OutputOutput a possible value of $$$f_k$$$, where $$$f_k$$$ is a positive integer satisfying $$$1 \leq f_k < p$$$. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. If no such $$$f_k$$$ makes $$$f_n = m$$$, output $$$-1$$$ instead.It is easy to show that if there are some possible values of $$$f_k$$$, there must be at least one satisfying $$$1 \leq f_k < p$$$.     math      matrices      number theory      *2400
