A. Frog Jumpingtime 1 secondmemory 256 A frog is currently at the point $$$0$$$ on a coordinate axis $$$Ox$$$. It jumps by the following algorithm: the first jump is $$$a$$$ units to the right, the second jump is $$$b$$$ units to the left, the third jump is $$$a$$$ units to the right, the fourth jump is $$$b$$$ units to the left, and so on.Formally:   if the frog has jumped an even number of times (before the current jump), it jumps from its current position $$$x$$$ to position $$$x+a$$$;  otherwise it jumps from its current position $$$x$$$ to position $$$x-b$$$. Your task is to calculate the position of the frog after $$$k$$$ jumps.But... One more thing. You are watching $$$t$$$ different frogs so you have to answer $$$t$$$ independent queries.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of queries.Each of the next $$$t$$$ lines contain queries (one query per line).The query is described as three space-separated integers $$$a, b, k$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b, k \le 10^9$$$) — the lengths of two types of jumps and the number of jumps, respectively.OutputPrint $$$t$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th integer should be the answer for the $$$i$$$-th query     math      *800
