B. Preparation for International Women's Daytime 2  256 International Women's Day is coming soon! Polycarp is preparing for the holiday.There are $$$n$$$ candy boxes in the shop for sale. The $$$i$$$-th box contains $$$d_i$$$ candies.Polycarp wants to prepare the maximum number of gifts for $$$k$$$ girls. Each gift will consist of exactly two boxes. The girls should be able to share each gift equally, so the total amount of candies in a gift (in a pair of boxes) should be divisible by $$$k$$$. In other words, two boxes $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$i \ne j$$$) can be combined as a gift if $$$d_i + d_j$$$ is divisible by $$$k$$$.How many boxes will Polycarp be able to give? Of course, each box can be a part of no more than one gift. Polycarp cannot use boxes "partially" or redistribute candies between them. InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le k \le 100$$$) — the number the boxes and the number the girls.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$$$ ($$$1 \le d_i \le 10^9$$$), where $$$d_i$$$ is the number of candies in the $$$i$$$-th box.OutputPrint one integer — the maximum number of the boxes Polycarp can give as gifts.     math      number theory      *1200
