H. Oracle for f(x) = parity of the number of 1s in xtime 1 secondmemory 256 Implement a quantum oracle on N qubits which implements the following function: , i.e., the value of the function is 1 if x has odd number of 1s, and 0 otherwise.InputYou have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs: an array of qubits x (input register), a qubit y (output qubit).The operation doesn't have an output; the "output" of your solution is the state in which it left the qubits.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;    operation Solve (x : Qubit[], y : Qubit) : ()    {        body        {            // your code here        }    }     *special problem      *1200
