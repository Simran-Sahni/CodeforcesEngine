A. Digits Sequence (Easy Edition)time 1 secondmemory 256 Let's write all the positive integer numbers one after another from $$$1$$$ without any delimiters (i.e. as a single string). It will be the infinite sequence starting with 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536...Your task is to print the $$$k$$$-th digit of this sequence.InputThe first and only line contains integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le 10000$$$) — the position to process ($$$1$$$-based index).OutputPrint the $$$k$$$-th digit of the resulting infinite sequence.     implementation      *1000
