C. Perfect Teamtime 2  256 You may have already known that a standard ICPC team consists of exactly three members. The perfect team however has more restrictions. A student can have some specialization: coder or mathematician. She/he can have no specialization, but can't have both at the same time.So the team is considered perfect if it includes at least one coder, at least one mathematician and it consists of exactly three members.You are a coach at a very large university and you know that $$$c$$$ of your students are coders, $$$m$$$ are mathematicians and $$$x$$$ have no specialization.What is the maximum number of full perfect teams you can distribute them into? Note that some students can be left without a team and each student can be a part of no more than one team.You are also asked to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 10^4$$$) — the number of queries. Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains three integers $$$c$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$0 \le c, m, x \le 10^8$$$) — the number of coders, mathematicians and students without any specialization in the university, respectively.Note that the no student is both coder and mathematician at the same time. OutputPrint $$$q$$$ integers — the $$$i$$$-th of them should be the answer to the $$$i$$$ query in the order they are given in the input. The answer is the maximum number of full perfect teams you can distribute your students into.     binary search      math      *1200
