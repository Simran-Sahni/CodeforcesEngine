G. Oracle for f(x) = k-th element of xtime 1 secondmemory 256 Implement a quantum oracle on N qubits which implements a function f(x) = xk, i.e. the value of the function is the value of the k-th qubit.For an explanation on how the quantum oracles work, see the tutorial blog post.InputYou have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs: an array of qubits x (input register), a qubit y (output qubit), 0-based index of the qubit from input register K ().The operation doesn't have an output; the "output" of your solution is the state in which it left the qubits.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;    operation Solve (x : Qubit[], y : Qubit, k : Int) : ()    {        body        {            // your code here        }    }     *special problem      *1400
