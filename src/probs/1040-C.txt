C. Timetabletime 2  512 There are two bus stops denoted A and B, and there $$$n$$$ buses that go from A to B every day. The shortest path from A to B takes $$$t$$$ units of time but some buses might take longer paths. Moreover, buses are allowed to overtake each other during the route.At each station one can find a sorted list of moments of time when a bus is at this station. We denote this list as $$$a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n$$$ for stop A and as $$$b_1 < b_2 < \ldots < b_n$$$ for stop B. The buses always depart from A and arrive to B according to the timetable, but the order in which the buses arrive may differ. Let's call an order of arrivals valid if each bus arrives at least $$$t$$$ units of time later than departs.It is known that for an order to be valid the latest possible arrival for the bus that departs at $$$a_i$$$ is $$$b_{x_i}$$$, i.e. $$$x_i$$$-th in the timetable. In other words, for each $$$i$$$ there exists such a valid order of arrivals that the bus departed $$$i$$$-th arrives $$$x_i$$$-th (and all other buses can arrive arbitrary), but there is no valid order of arrivals in which the $$$i$$$-th departed bus arrives $$$(x_i + 1)$$$-th.Formally, let's call a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ valid, if $$$b_{p_i} \ge a_i + t$$$ for all $$$i$$$. Then $$$x_i$$$ is the maximum value of $$$p_i$$$ among all valid permutations.You are given the sequences $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ and $$$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$$$, but not the arrival timetable. Find out any suitable timetable for stop B $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ or determine that there is no such timetable.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 200\,000$$$, $$$1 \leq t \leq 10^{18}$$$) — the number of buses in timetable for and the minimum possible travel time from stop A to stop B.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^{18}$$$), defining the moments of time when the buses leave stop A.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq x_i \leq n$$$), the $$$i$$$-th of them stands for the maximum possible timetable position, at which the $$$i$$$-th bus leaving stop A can arrive at stop B. OutputIf a solution exists, print "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line of the output.In the second line print $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq b_1 < b_2 < \ldots < b_n \leq 3 \cdot 10^{18}$$$). We can show that if there exists any solution, there exists a solution that satisfies such constraints on $$$b_i$$$. If there are multiple valid answers you can print any of them.If there is no valid timetable, print "No" (without quotes) in the only line of the output.     constructive algorithms      math      *2300
