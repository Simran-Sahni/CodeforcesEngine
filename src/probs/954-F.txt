F. Runner's Problemtime 4  256 You are running through a rectangular field. This field can be represented as a matrix with 3 rows and m columns. (i, j) denotes a cell belonging to i-th row and j-th column.You start in (2, 1) and have to end your path in (2, m). From the cell (i, j) you may advance to:  (i - 1, j + 1) — only if i > 1,  (i, j + 1), or  (i + 1, j + 1) — only if i < 3. However, there are n obstacles blocking your path. k-th obstacle is denoted by three integers ak, lk and rk, and it forbids entering any cell (ak, j) such that lk ≤ j ≤ rk.You have to calculate the number of different paths from (2, 1) to (2, m), and print it modulo 109 + 7.InputThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 104, 3 ≤ m ≤ 1018) — the number of obstacles and the number of columns in the matrix, respectively.Then n lines follow, each containing three integers ak, lk and rk (1 ≤ ak ≤ 3, 2 ≤ lk ≤ rk ≤ m - 1) denoting an obstacle blocking every cell (ak, j) such that lk ≤ j ≤ rk. Some cells may be blocked by multiple obstacles.OutputPrint the number of different paths from (2, 1) to (2, m), taken modulo 109 + 7. If it is impossible to get from (2, 1) to (2, m), then the number of paths is 0     dp      matrices      sortings      *2100
