B2. Distinguish GHZ state and W statetime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given N qubits (2 ≤ N ≤ 8) which are guaranteed to be in one of the two states:   state, or  state. Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which state it was and to return 0 if it was GHZ state or 1 if it was W state. The state of the qubits after the operations does not matter.You have to implement an operation which takes an array of N qubits as an input and returns an integer. Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : Int    {        body        {            // your code here        }    }     *1600
