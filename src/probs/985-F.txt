F. Isomorphic Stringstime 3  256 You are given a string s of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.For two given strings s and t, say S is the set of distinct characters of s and T is the set of distinct characters of t. The strings s and t are isomorphic if their lengths are equal and there is a one-to-one mapping (bijection) f between S and T for which f(si) = ti. Formally:  f(si) = ti for any index i,  for any character  there is exactly one character  that f(x) = y,  for any character  there is exactly one character  that f(x) = y. For example, the strings "aababc" and "bbcbcz" are isomorphic. Also the strings "aaaww" and "wwwaa" are isomorphic. The following pairs of strings are not isomorphic: "aab" and "bbb", "test" and "best".You have to handle m queries characterized by three integers x, y, len (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n - len + 1). For each query check if two substrings s[x... x + len - 1] and s[y... y + len - 1] are isomorphic.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105) — the length of the string s and the number of queries.The second line contains string s consisting of n lowercase English letters.The following m lines contain a single query on each line: xi, yi and leni (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, 1 ≤ leni ≤ n - max(xi, yi) + 1) — the description of the pair of the substrings to check.OutputFor each query in a separate line print "YES" if substrings s[xi... xi + leni - 1] and s[yi... yi + leni - 1] are isomorphic and "NO" otherwise     hashing      strings      *2300
