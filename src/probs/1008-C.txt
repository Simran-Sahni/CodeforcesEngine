C. Reorder the Arraytime 2  256 You are given an array of integers. Vasya can permute (change order) its integers. He wants to do it so that as many as possible integers will become on a place where a smaller integer used to stand. Help Vasya find the maximal number of such integers.For instance, if we are given an array $$$[10, 20, 30, 40]$$$, we can permute it so that it becomes $$$[20, 40, 10, 30]$$$. Then on the first and the second positions the integers became larger ($$$20>10$$$, $$$40>20$$$) and did not on the third and the fourth, so for this permutation, the number that Vasya wants to maximize equals $$$2$$$. Read the note for the first example, there is one more demonstrative test case.Help Vasya to permute integers in such way that the number of positions in a new array, where integers are greater than in the original one, is maximal.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$) — the length of the array.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array.OutputPrint a single integer — the maximal number of the array's elements which after a permutation will stand on the position where a smaller element stood in the initial array.     combinatorics      math      *1300
