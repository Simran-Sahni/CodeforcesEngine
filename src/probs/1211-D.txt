D. Teamstime 3  256 There are $$$n$$$ table bowling players, the rating of the $$$i$$$-th player equals $$$r_i$$$. Compose a maximum number of teams in a such way that:  each player belongs to at most one team;  each team contains exactly $$$a+b$$$ players;  each team contains a group of $$$a$$$ players with the same rating and a group of $$$b$$$ players with another same rating, which must be $$$k$$$ times larger than the rating of the players in the first group. For example, if $$$n=12$$$, $$$r=[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6]$$$, $$$a=1$$$, $$$b=2$$$, $$$k=2$$$, you can compose two teams with ratings $$$[1, 2, 2]$$$ and one team with ratings $$$[3, 6, 6]$$$. So, the maximum number of teams is $$$3$$$.Find the maximum number of teams by given $$$n, r_1 \dots r_n, a, b$$$ and $$$k$$$ to compose in respect to the given requirements.InputThe first line of the input contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n,a,b \le 3\cdot10^5$$$, $$$2 \le k \le 1000$$$). The second line contains the sequence of player's ratings — integers $$$r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n$$$ ($$$1 \le r_i \le 10^6$$$).OutputPrint only one integer — the maximum number of teams that can be composed from $$$n$$$ given players.     *special problem      binary search      greedy      math      *2000
