G. Magic multisetstime 4  256 In the School of Magic in Dirtpolis a lot of interesting objects are studied on Computer Science lessons.Consider, for example, the magic multiset. If you try to add an integer to it that is already presented in the multiset, each element in the multiset duplicates. For example, if you try to add the integer $$$2$$$ to the multiset $$$\{1, 2, 3, 3\}$$$, you will get $$$\{1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3\}$$$. If you try to add an integer that is not presented in the multiset, it is simply added to it. For example, if you try to add the integer $$$4$$$ to the multiset $$$\{1, 2, 3, 3\}$$$, you will get $$$\{1, 2, 3, 3, 4\}$$$.Also consider an array of $$$n$$$ initially empty magic multisets, enumerated from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.You are to answer $$$q$$$ queries of the form "add an integer $$$x$$$ to all multisets with indices $$$l, l + 1, \ldots, r$$$" and "compute the sum of sizes of multisets with indices $$$l, l + 1, \ldots, r$$$". The answers for the second type queries can be large, so print the answers modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, q \leq 2 \cdot 10^{5}$$$) — the number of magic multisets in the array and the number of queries, respectively.The next $$$q$$$ lines describe queries, one per line. Each line starts with an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 2$$$) — the type of the query. If $$$t$$$ equals $$$1$$$, it is followed by three integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$, $$$1 \leq x \leq n$$$) meaning that you should add $$$x$$$ to all multisets with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusive. If $$$t$$$ equals $$$2$$$, it is followed by two integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$) meaning that you should compute the sum of sizes of all multisets with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusive.OutputFor each query of the second type print the sum of sizes of multisets on the given segment.The answers can be large, so print them modulo $$$998244353$$$.     data structures      *2500
