A. Minimum Integertime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given $$$q$$$ queries in the following form:Given three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$ and $$$d_i$$$, find minimum positive integer $$$x_i$$$ such that it is divisible by $$$d_i$$$ and it does not belong to the segment $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$.Can you answer all the queries?Recall that a number $$$x$$$ belongs to segment $$$[l, r]$$$ if $$$l \le x \le r$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 500$$$) — the number of queries.Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, each containing a query given in the format $$$l_i$$$ $$$r_i$$$ $$$d_i$$$ ($$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \le d_i \le 10^9$$$). $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$ and $$$d_i$$$ are integers.OutputFor each query print one integer: the answer to this query     math      *1000
