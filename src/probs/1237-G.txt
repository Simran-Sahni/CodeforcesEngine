G. Balanced Distributiontime 2  512 There are $$$n$$$ friends living on a circular street. The friends and their houses are numbered clockwise from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$.Initially person $$$i$$$ has $$$a_i$$$ stones. The friends want to make the distribution of stones among them perfectly balanced: everyone should possess the same number of stones.The only way to change the distribution of stones is by conducting meetings. During a meeting, people from exactly $$$k$$$ consecutive houses (remember that the street is circular) gather at the same place and bring all their stones with them. All brought stones may be redistributed among people attending the meeting arbitrarily. The total number of stones they possess before the meeting and after the meeting must stay the same. After the meeting, everyone returns to their home.Find a way to make the distribution of stones perfectly balanced conducting as few meetings as possible.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le k < n \le 10^5$$$), denoting the number of friends and the size of each meeting.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^4$$$), denoting the number of stones people initially have.The sum of all $$$a_i$$$ is divisible by $$$n$$$.OutputOutput the minimum number of meetings $$$m$$$ ($$$m \ge 0$$$), followed by $$$m$$$ descriptions of meetings in chronological order.The $$$i$$$-th description must consist of an integer $$$s_i$$$ ($$$0 \le s_i < n$$$), followed by $$$k$$$ non-negative integers $$$b_{i, 0}, b_{i, 1}, \ldots, b_{i, k-1}$$$ ($$$b_{i, j} \ge 0$$$). Such a description denotes a meeting of people $$$s_i, (s_i + 1) \bmod n, \ldots, (s_i + k - 1) \bmod n$$$, and $$$b_{i,j}$$$ denotes the number of stones person $$$(s_i + j) \bmod n$$$ must have after the $$$i$$$-th meeting. The sum of $$$b_{i, j}$$$ must match the total number of stones owned by these people before the $$$i$$$-th meeting.We can show that a solution exists for any valid input, and any correct output contains at most $$$10^7$$$ non-whitespace characters.     data structures      dp      greedy      *3500
