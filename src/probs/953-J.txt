J. Segmentstime 1 secondmemory 256 There is a straight line colored in white. n black segments are added on it one by one.After each segment is added, determine the number of connected components of black segments (i. e. the number of black segments in the union of the black segments). In particular, if one segment ends in a point x, and another segment starts in the point x, these two segments belong to the same connected component.InputThe first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of segments.The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers li and ri (1 ≤ li < ri ≤ 109) — the coordinates of the left and the right ends of the i-th segment. The segments are listed in the order they are added on the white line.OutputPrint n integers — the number of connected components of black segments after each segment is added.      *2100
