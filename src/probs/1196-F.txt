F. K-th Pathtime 2.5  256 You are given a connected undirected weighted graph consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges.You need to print the $$$k$$$-th smallest shortest path in this graph (paths from the vertex to itself are not counted, paths from $$$i$$$ to $$$j$$$ and from $$$j$$$ to $$$i$$$ are counted as one).More formally, if $$$d$$$ is the matrix of shortest paths, where $$$d_{i, j}$$$ is the length of the shortest path between vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le i < j \le n$$$), then you need to print the $$$k$$$-th element in the sorted array consisting of all $$$d_{i, j}$$$, where $$$1 \le i < j \le n$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains three integers $$$n, m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$n - 1 \le m \le \min\Big(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5\Big)$$$, $$$1 \le k \le \min\Big(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 400\Big)$$$ — the number of vertices in the graph, the number of edges in the graph and the value of $$$k$$$, correspondingly.Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, each containing three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ and $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \le x, y \le n$$$, $$$1 \le w \le 10^9$$$, $$$x \ne y$$$) denoting an edge between vertices $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ of weight $$$w$$$.It is guaranteed that the given graph is connected (there is a path between any pair of vertices), there are no self-loops (edges connecting the vertex with itself) and multiple edges (for each pair of vertices $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, there is at most one edge between this pair of vertices in the graph).OutputPrint one integer — the length of the $$$k$$$-th smallest shortest path in the given graph (paths from the vertex to itself are not counted, paths from $$$i$$$ to $$$j$$$ and from $$$j$$$ to $$$i$$$ are counted as one).     brute force      constructive algorithms      shortest paths      sortings      *2200
