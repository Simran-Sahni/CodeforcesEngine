D. Beautiful Arraytime 2  256 You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. Beauty of array is the maximum sum of some consecutive subarray of this array (this subarray may be empty). For example, the beauty of the array [10, -5, 10, -4, 1] is 15, and the beauty of the array [-3, -5, -1] is 0.You may choose at most one consecutive subarray of $$$a$$$ and multiply all values contained in this subarray by $$$x$$$. You want to maximize the beauty of array after applying at most one such operation.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, -100 \le x \le 100$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$ and the integer $$$x$$$ respectively.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.OutputPrint one integer — the maximum possible beauty of array $$$a$$$ after multiplying all values belonging to some consecutive subarray $$$x$$$.     brute force      data structures      divide and conquer      dp      greedy      *1900
