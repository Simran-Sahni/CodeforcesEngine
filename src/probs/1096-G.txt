G. Lucky Ticketstime 5  256 All bus tickets in Berland have their numbers. A number consists of $$$n$$$ digits ($$$n$$$ is even). Only $$$k$$$ decimal digits $$$d_1, d_2, \dots, d_k$$$ can be used to form ticket numbers. If $$$0$$$ is among these digits, then numbers may have leading zeroes. For example, if $$$n = 4$$$ and only digits $$$0$$$ and $$$4$$$ can be used, then $$$0000$$$, $$$4004$$$, $$$4440$$$ are valid ticket numbers, and $$$0002$$$, $$$00$$$, $$$44443$$$ are not.A ticket is lucky if the sum of first $$$n / 2$$$ digits is equal to the sum of remaining $$$n / 2$$$ digits. Calculate the number of different lucky tickets in Berland. Since the answer may be big, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ $$$(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le k \le 10)$$$ — the number of digits in each ticket number, and the number of different decimal digits that may be used. $$$n$$$ is even.The second line contains a sequence of pairwise distinct integers $$$d_1, d_2, \dots, d_k$$$ $$$(0 \le d_i \le 9)$$$ — the digits that may be used in ticket numbers. The digits are given in arbitrary order.OutputPrint the number of lucky ticket numbers, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.     divide and conquer      dp      fft      *2400
