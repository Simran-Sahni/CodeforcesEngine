D. Mysterious Codetime 2  256 During a normal walk in the forest, Katie has stumbled upon a mysterious code! However, the mysterious code had some characters unreadable. She has written down this code as a string $$$c$$$ consisting of lowercase English characters and asterisks ("*"), where each of the asterisks denotes an unreadable character. Excited with her discovery, Katie has decided to recover the unreadable characters by replacing each asterisk with arbitrary lowercase English letter (different asterisks might be replaced with different letters).Katie has a favorite string $$$s$$$ and a not-so-favorite string $$$t$$$ and she would love to recover the mysterious code so that it has as many occurrences of $$$s$$$ as possible and as little occurrences of $$$t$$$ as possible. Formally, let's denote $$$f(x, y)$$$ as the number of occurrences of $$$y$$$ in $$$x$$$ (for example, $$$f(aababa, ab) = 2$$$). Katie wants to recover the code $$$c'$$$ conforming to the original $$$c$$$, such that $$$f(c', s) - f(c', t)$$$ is largest possible. However, Katie is not very good at recovering codes in general, so she would like you to help her out.InputThe first line contains string $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \leq |c| \leq 1000$$$) — the mysterious code . It is guaranteed that $$$c$$$ consists of lowercase English characters and asterisks "*" only.The second and third line contain strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ respectively ($$$1 \leq |s|, |t| \leq 50$$$, $$$s \neq t$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ consist of lowercase English characters only.OutputPrint a single integer — the largest possible value of $$$f(c', s) - f(c', t)$$$ of the recovered code.     dp      strings      *2100
