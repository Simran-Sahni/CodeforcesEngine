G. Puzzling Languagetime 1 secondmemory 256 In this problem you will write a simple code generator for a 2D programming language derived from Brainfuck.The code in this language is a rectangular grid of characters '.' and 'X'. The code is converted to a Brainfuck program as follows: the characters are read in the usual order (top to bottom, left to right), and each 'X' character is converted a Brainfuck instruction to be executed. The instruction is defined by the left, top and right neighbors of the 'X' character using the following conversion table:  You are given a string. Output a program in the described language which prints this string.You can download the language interpreter used for judging here: https://assets.codeforces.com/rounds/952/puzzling-interpreter.cpp (use C++11 to compile the code). Note several implementation details: The first step of the language interpretation is conversion to a Brainfuck program, which is then executed. The code must be rectangular, with all lines of the same length. It can have at most 10,000 lines and 10,000 columns, and can have at most 500,000 'X' characters. The code has toroidal topology, i.e. the 'X' on the first line will have top neighbor in the last line. Brainfuck interpreter has 30000 memory cells which store integers from 0 to 255 with increment/decrement done modulo 256. Console input (, command) is allowed in Brainfuck code but has no effect when executed.InputThe input consists of a single string of characters with ASCII codes between 33 ('!') and 122 ('z'), inclusive. The length of the string is between 1 and 10 characters, inclusive.OutputOutput a program in the described language which, when executed, will print the given message     constructive algorithms      *2200
