A. Alternating Sumtime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. Moreover, you are given a sequence $$$s_0, s_1, \dots, s_{n}$$$. All values in $$$s$$$ are integers $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$. It's known that sequence is $$$k$$$-periodic and $$$k$$$ divides $$$n+1$$$. In other words, for each $$$k \leq i \leq n$$$ it's satisfied that $$$s_{i} = s_{i - k}$$$.Find out the non-negative remainder of division of $$$\sum \limits_{i=0}^{n} s_{i} a^{n - i} b^{i}$$$ by $$$10^{9} + 9$$$.Note that the modulo is unusual!InputThe first line contains four integers $$$n, a, b$$$ and $$$k$$$ $$$(1 \leq n \leq 10^{9}, 1 \leq a, b \leq 10^{9}, 1 \leq k \leq 10^{5})$$$.The second line contains a sequence of length $$$k$$$ consisting of characters '+' and '-'. If the $$$i$$$-th character (0-indexed) is '+', then $$$s_{i} = 1$$$, otherwise $$$s_{i} = -1$$$.Note that only the first $$$k$$$ members of the sequence are given, the rest can be obtained using the periodicity property.OutputOutput a single integer — value of given expression modulo $$$10^{9} + 9$$$.     math      number theory      *1800
