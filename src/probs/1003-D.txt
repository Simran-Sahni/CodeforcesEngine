D. Coins and Queriestime 2  256 Polycarp has $$$n$$$ coins, the value of the $$$i$$$-th coin is $$$a_i$$$. It is guaranteed that all the values are integer powers of $$$2$$$ (i.e. $$$a_i = 2^d$$$ for some non-negative integer number $$$d$$$).Polycarp wants to know answers on $$$q$$$ queries. The $$$j$$$-th query is described as integer number $$$b_j$$$. The answer to the query is the minimum number of coins that is necessary to obtain the value $$$b_j$$$ using some subset of coins (Polycarp can use only coins he has). If Polycarp can't obtain the value $$$b_j$$$, the answer to the $$$j$$$-th query is -1.The queries are independent (the answer on the query doesn't affect Polycarp's coins).InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of coins and the number of queries.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ — values of coins ($$$1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that all $$$a_i$$$ are integer powers of $$$2$$$ (i.e. $$$a_i = 2^d$$$ for some non-negative integer number $$$d$$$).The next $$$q$$$ lines contain one integer each. The $$$j$$$-th line contains one integer $$$b_j$$$ — the value of the $$$j$$$-th query ($$$1 \le b_j \le 10^9$$$).OutputPrint $$$q$$$ integers $$$ans_j$$$. The $$$j$$$-th integer must be equal to the answer on the $$$j$$$-th query. If Polycarp can't obtain the value $$$b_j$$$ the answer to the $$$j$$$-th query is -1     greedy      *1600
