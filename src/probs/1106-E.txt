E. Lunar New Year and Red Envelopestime 3  256 Lunar New Year is approaching, and Bob is going to receive some red envelopes with countless money! But collecting money from red envelopes is a time-consuming process itself.Let's describe this problem in a mathematical way. Consider a timeline from time $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th red envelope will be available from time $$$s_i$$$ to $$$t_i$$$, inclusive, and contain $$$w_i$$$ coins. If Bob chooses to collect the coins in the $$$i$$$-th red envelope, he can do it only in an integer point of time between $$$s_i$$$ and $$$t_i$$$, inclusive, and he can't collect any more envelopes until time $$$d_i$$$ (inclusive) after that. Here $$$s_i \leq t_i \leq d_i$$$ holds.Bob is a greedy man, he collects coins greedily — whenever he can collect coins at some integer time $$$x$$$, he collects the available red envelope with the maximum number of coins. If there are multiple envelopes with the same maximum number of coins, Bob would choose the one whose parameter $$$d$$$ is the largest. If there are still multiple choices, Bob will choose one from them randomly.However, Alice — his daughter — doesn't want her father to get too many coins. She could disturb Bob at no more than $$$m$$$ integer time moments. If Alice decides to disturb Bob at time $$$x$$$, he could not do anything at time $$$x$$$ and resumes his usual strategy at the time $$$x + 1$$$ (inclusive), which may lead to missing some red envelopes.Calculate the minimum number of coins Bob would get if Alice disturbs him optimally.InputThe first line contains three non-negative integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$, $$$0 \leq m \leq 200$$$, $$$1 \leq k \leq 10^5$$$), denoting the length of the timeline, the number of times Alice can disturb Bob and the total number of red envelopes, respectively.The following $$$k$$$ lines describe those $$$k$$$ red envelopes. The $$$i$$$-th line contains four positive integers $$$s_i$$$, $$$t_i$$$, $$$d_i$$$ and $$$w_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq s_i \leq t_i \leq d_i \leq n$$$, $$$1 \leq w_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the time segment when the $$$i$$$-th envelope is available, the time moment Bob can continue collecting after collecting the $$$i$$$-th envelope, and the number of coins in this envelope, respectively.OutputOutput one integer — the minimum number of coins Bob would get if Alice disturbs him optimally.     data structures      dp      *2100
