B. Substrings Sorttime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given $$$n$$$ strings. Each string consists of lowercase English letters. Rearrange (reorder) the given strings in such a way that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings.String $$$a$$$ is a substring of string $$$b$$$ if it is possible to choose several consecutive letters in $$$b$$$ in such a way that they form $$$a$$$. For example, string "for" is contained as a substring in strings "codeforces", "for" and "therefore", but is not contained as a substring in strings "four", "fofo" and "rof".InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$) — the number of strings.The next $$$n$$$ lines contain the given strings. The number of letters in each string is from $$$1$$$ to $$$100$$$, inclusive. Each string consists of lowercase English letters.Some strings might be equal.OutputIf it is impossible to reorder $$$n$$$ given strings in required order, print "NO" (without quotes).Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and $$$n$$$ given strings in required order.     sortings      strings      *1100
