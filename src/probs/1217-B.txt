B. Zmei Gorynichtime 1 secondmemory 256 You are fighting with Zmei Gorynich — a ferocious monster from Slavic myths, a huge dragon-like reptile with multiple heads!   Initially Zmei Gorynich has $$$x$$$ heads. You can deal $$$n$$$ types of blows. If you deal a blow of the $$$i$$$-th type, you decrease the number of Gorynich's heads by $$$min(d_i, curX)$$$, there $$$curX$$$ is the current number of heads. But if after this blow Zmei Gorynich has at least one head, he grows $$$h_i$$$ new heads. If $$$curX = 0$$$ then Gorynich is defeated. You can deal each blow any number of times, in any order.For example, if $$$curX = 10$$$, $$$d = 7$$$, $$$h = 10$$$ then the number of heads changes to $$$13$$$ (you cut $$$7$$$ heads off, but then Zmei grows $$$10$$$ new ones), but if $$$curX = 10$$$, $$$d = 11$$$, $$$h = 100$$$ then number of heads changes to $$$0$$$ and Zmei Gorynich is considered defeated.Calculate the minimum number of blows to defeat Zmei Gorynich!You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent queries.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) – the number of queries.The first line of each query contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$, $$$1 \le x \le 10^9$$$) — the number of possible types of blows and the number of heads Zmei initially has, respectively.The following $$$n$$$ lines of each query contain the descriptions of types of blows you can deal. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$d_i$$$ and $$$h_i$$$ ($$$1 \le d_i, h_i \le 10^9$$$) — the description of the $$$i$$$-th blow.OutputFor each query print the minimum number of blows you have to deal to defeat Zmei Gorynich. If Zmei Gorynuch cannot be defeated print $$$-1$$$     greedy      math      *1600
