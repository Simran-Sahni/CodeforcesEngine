G. AI robotstime 2  256 In the last mission, MDCS has successfully shipped $$$N$$$ AI robots to Mars. Before they start exploring, system initialization is required so they are arranged in a line. Every robot can be described with three numbers: position ($$$x_i$$$), radius of sight ($$$r_i$$$) and IQ ($$$q_i$$$).Since they are intelligent robots, some of them will talk if they see each other. Radius of sight is inclusive, so robot can see other all robots in range $$$[x_i - r_i, x_i + r_i]$$$. But they don't walk to talk with anybody, but only with robots who have similar IQ. By similar IQ we mean that their absolute difference isn't more than $$$K$$$.  Help us and calculate how many pairs of robots are going to talk with each other, so we can timely update their software and avoid any potential quarrel.InputThe first line contains two integers, numbers $$$N (1 \leq N \leq 10^5) $$$ and $$$K (0 \leq K \leq 20)$$$.Next $$$N$$$ lines contain three numbers each $$$x_i, r_i, q_i (0 \leq x_i,r_i,q_i \leq 10^9)$$$ — position, radius of sight and IQ of every robot respectively.OutputOutput contains only one number — solution to the problem     data structures      *2200
