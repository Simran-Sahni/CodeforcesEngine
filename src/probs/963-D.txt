D. Frequency of Stringtime 1.5  512 You are given a string $$$s$$$. You should answer $$$n$$$ queries. The $$$i$$$-th query consists of integer $$$k_i$$$ and string $$$m_i$$$. The answer for this query is the minimum length of such a string $$$t$$$ that $$$t$$$ is a substring of $$$s$$$ and $$$m_i$$$ has at least $$$k_i$$$ occurrences as a substring in $$$t$$$.A substring of a string is a continuous segment of characters of the string.It is guaranteed that for any two queries the strings $$$m_i$$$ from these queries are different. InputThe first line contains string $$$s$$$ $$$(1 \leq \left | s \right | \leq 10^{5})$$$.The second line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$).Each of next $$$n$$$ lines contains an integer $$$k_i$$$ $$$(1 \leq k_i \leq |s|)$$$ and a non-empty string $$$m_i$$$ — parameters of the query with number $$$i$$$, in this order.All strings in input consists of lowercase English letters. Sum of length of all strings in input doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$. All $$$m_i$$$ are distinct.OutputFor each query output the answer for it in a separate line.If a string $$$m_{i}$$$ occurs in $$$s$$$ less that $$$k_{i}$$$ times, output -1.     hashing      string suffix structures      strings      *2500
