A. Regular Bracket Sequencetime 1 secondmemory 256 A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than "(" and ")". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, "", "(())" and "()()" are regular bracket sequences; "))" and ")((" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and "(a)" and "(1)+(1)" are not bracket sequences at all.You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $$$2$$$. So, overall you have $$$cnt_1$$$ strings "((", $$$cnt_2$$$ strings "()", $$$cnt_3$$$ strings ")(" and $$$cnt_4$$$ strings "))". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $$$2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$$$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.InputThe input consists of four lines, $$$i$$$-th of them contains one integer $$$cnt_i$$$ ($$$0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$$$).OutputPrint one integer: $$$1$$$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $$$0$$$ otherwise.     greedy      implementation      *1100
