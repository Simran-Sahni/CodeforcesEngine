D1. Oracle for f(x) = b * x mod 2time 1 secondmemory 256 Implement a quantum oracle on N qubits which implements the following function: , where  (a vector of N integers, each of which can be 0 or 1).For an explanation on how this type of quantum oracles works, see Introduction to quantum oracles.You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs: an array of N qubits x in arbitrary state (input register), 1 ≤ N ≤ 8, a qubit y in arbitrary state (output qubit), an array of N integers b, representing the vector . Each element of b will be 0 or 1.The operation doesn't have an output; its "output" is the state in which it leaves the qubits.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;    operation Solve (x : Qubit[], y : Qubit, b : Int[]) : ()    {        body        {            // your code here        }    }     *1200
