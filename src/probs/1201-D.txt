D. Treasure Huntingtime 3  256 You are on the island which can be represented as a $$$n \times m$$$ table. The rows are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and the columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. There are $$$k$$$ treasures on the island, the $$$i$$$-th of them is located at the position $$$(r_i, c_i)$$$.Initially you stand at the lower left corner of the island, at the position $$$(1, 1)$$$. If at any moment you are at the cell with a treasure, you can pick it up without any extra time. In one move you can move up (from $$$(r, c)$$$ to $$$(r+1, c)$$$), left (from $$$(r, c)$$$ to $$$(r, c-1)$$$), or right (from position $$$(r, c)$$$ to $$$(r, c+1)$$$). Because of the traps, you can't move down.However, moving up is also risky. You can move up only if you are in a safe column. There are $$$q$$$ safe columns: $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_q$$$. You want to collect all the treasures as fast as possible. Count the minimum number of moves required to collect all the treasures.InputThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \le n, \, m, \, k, \, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$q \le m$$$) — the number of rows, the number of columns, the number of treasures in the island and the number of safe columns.Each of the next $$$k$$$ lines contains two integers $$$r_i, c_i$$$, ($$$1 \le r_i \le n$$$, $$$1 \le c_i \le m$$$) — the coordinates of the cell with a treasure. All treasures are located in distinct cells.The last line contains $$$q$$$ distinct integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_q$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le m$$$) — the indices of safe columns.OutputPrint the minimum number of moves required to collect all the treasures.     binary search      dp      greedy      implementation      *2100
