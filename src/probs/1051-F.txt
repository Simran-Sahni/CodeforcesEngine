F. The Shortest Statementtime 4  256 You are given a weighed undirected connected graph, consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges.You should answer $$$q$$$ queries, the $$$i$$$-th query is to find the shortest distance between vertices $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m~(1 \le n, m \le 10^5, m - n \le 20)$$$ — the number of vertices and edges in the graph.Next $$$m$$$ lines contain the edges: the $$$i$$$-th edge is a triple of integers $$$v_i, u_i, d_i~(1 \le u_i, v_i \le n, 1 \le d_i \le 10^9, u_i \neq v_i)$$$. This triple means that there is an edge between vertices $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ of weight $$$d_i$$$. It is guaranteed that graph contains no self-loops and multiple edges.The next line contains a single integer $$$q~(1 \le q \le 10^5)$$$ — the number of queries.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i~(1 \le u_i, v_i \le n)$$$ — descriptions of the queries.Pay attention to the restriction $$$m - n ~ \le ~ 20$$$.OutputPrint $$$q$$$ lines.The $$$i$$$-th line should contain the answer to the $$$i$$$-th query — the shortest distance between vertices $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$.     graphs      shortest paths      trees      *2400
