B. Reversing Encryptiontime 1 secondmemory 256 A string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ can be encrypted by the following algorithm:  iterate over all divisors of $$$n$$$ in decreasing order (i.e. from $$$n$$$ to $$$1$$$),  for each divisor $$$d$$$, reverse the substring $$$s[1 \dots d]$$$ (i.e. the substring which starts at position $$$1$$$ and ends at position $$$d$$$). For example, the above algorithm applied to the string $$$s$$$="codeforces" leads to the following changes: "codeforces" $$$\to$$$ "secrofedoc" $$$\to$$$ "orcesfedoc" $$$\to$$$ "rocesfedoc" $$$\to$$$ "rocesfedoc" (obviously, the last reverse operation doesn't change the string because $$$d=1$$$).You are given the encrypted string $$$t$$$. Your task is to decrypt this string, i.e., to find a string $$$s$$$ such that the above algorithm results in string $$$t$$$. It can be proven that this string $$$s$$$ always exists and is unique.InputThe first line of input consists of a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$) — the length of the string $$$t$$$. The second line of input consists of the string $$$t$$$. The length of $$$t$$$ is $$$n$$$, and it consists only of lowercase Latin letters.OutputPrint a string $$$s$$$ such that the above algorithm results in $$$t$$$.     implementation      *900
