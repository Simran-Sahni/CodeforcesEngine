C. Is This a Zebra?time 1 secondmemory 256 A camera you have accidentally left in a desert has taken an interesting photo. The photo has a resolution of n pixels width, and each column of this photo is all white or all black. Thus, we can represent the photo as a sequence of n zeros and ones, where 0 means that the corresponding column is all white, and 1 means that the corresponding column is black.You think that this photo can contain a zebra. In this case the whole photo should consist of several (possibly, only one) alternating black and white stripes of equal width. For example, the photo [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0] can be a photo of zebra, while the photo [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] can not, because the width of the black stripe is 3, while the width of the white stripe is 4. Can the given photo be a photo of zebra or not?InputThe first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the width of the photo.The second line contains a sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 1) — the description of the photo. If ai is zero, the i-th column is all black. If ai is one, then the i-th column is all white.OutputIf the photo can be a photo of zebra, print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise, print "NO".You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).     *1700
