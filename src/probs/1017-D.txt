D. The Wutime 2  256 Childan is making up a legendary story and trying to sell his forgery — a necklace with a strong sense of "Wu" to the Kasouras. But Mr. Kasoura is challenging the truth of Childan's story. So he is going to ask a few questions about Childan's so-called "personal treasure" necklace.This "personal treasure" is a multiset $$$S$$$ of $$$m$$$ "01-strings".A "01-string" is a string that contains $$$n$$$ characters "0" and "1". For example, if $$$n=4$$$, strings "0110", "0000", and "1110" are "01-strings", but "00110" (there are $$$5$$$ characters, not $$$4$$$) and "zero" (unallowed characters) are not.Note that the multiset $$$S$$$ can contain equal elements.Frequently, Mr. Kasoura will provide a "01-string" $$$t$$$ and ask Childan how many strings $$$s$$$ are in the multiset $$$S$$$ such that the "Wu" value of the pair $$$(s, t)$$$ is not greater than $$$k$$$. Mrs. Kasoura and Mr. Kasoura think that if $$$s_i = t_i$$$ ($$$1\leq i\leq n$$$) then the "Wu" value of the character pair equals to $$$w_i$$$, otherwise $$$0$$$. The "Wu" value of the "01-string" pair is the sum of the "Wu" values of every character pair. Note that the length of every "01-string" is equal to $$$n$$$.For example, if $$$w=[4, 5, 3, 6]$$$, "Wu" of ("1001", "1100") is $$$7$$$ because these strings have equal characters only on the first and third positions, so $$$w_1+w_3=4+3=7$$$.You need to help Childan to answer Mr. Kasoura's queries. That is to find the number of strings in the multiset $$$S$$$ such that the "Wu" value of the pair is not greater than $$$k$$$.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$1\leq n\leq 12$$$, $$$1\leq q, m\leq 5\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the "01-strings", the size of the multiset $$$S$$$, and the number of queries.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$$$ ($$$0 \le w_i \le 100$$$) — the value of the $$$i$$$-th caracter.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains the "01-string" $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ — the string in the multiset $$$S$$$.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains the "01-string" $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0\leq k\leq 100$$$) — the query.OutputFor each query, print the answer for this query.     bitmasks      brute force      data structures      *1900
