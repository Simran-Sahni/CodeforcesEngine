F. One-Based Arithmetictime 0.5  256 Prof. Vasechkin wants to represent positive integer n as a sum of addends, where each addends is an integer number containing only 1s. For example, he can represent 121 as 121=111+11+–1. Help him to find the least number of digits 1 in such sum.InputThe first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n < 1015).OutputPrint expected minimal number of digits 1.     *special problem      brute force      *1800
