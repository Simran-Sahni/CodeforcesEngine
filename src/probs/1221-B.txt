B. Knightstime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given a chess board with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns. Initially all cells of the board are empty, and you have to put a white or a black knight into each cell of the board.A knight is a chess piece that can attack a piece in cell ($$$x_2$$$, $$$y_2$$$) from the cell ($$$x_1$$$, $$$y_1$$$) if one of the following conditions is met:  $$$|x_1 - x_2| = 2$$$ and $$$|y_1 - y_2| = 1$$$, or  $$$|x_1 - x_2| = 1$$$ and $$$|y_1 - y_2| = 2$$$. Here are some examples of which cells knight can attack. In each of the following pictures, if the knight is currently in the blue cell, it can attack all red cells (and only them).  A duel of knights is a pair of knights of different colors such that these knights attack each other. You have to put a knight (a white one or a black one) into each cell in such a way that the number of duels is maximum possible.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 100$$$) — the number of rows (and columns) in the board.OutputPrint $$$n$$$ lines with $$$n$$$ characters in each line. The $$$j$$$-th character in the $$$i$$$-th line should be W, if the cell ($$$i$$$, $$$j$$$) contains a white knight, or B, if it contains a black knight. The number of duels should be maximum possible. If there are multiple optimal answers, print any of them     constructive algorithms      greedy      *1100
