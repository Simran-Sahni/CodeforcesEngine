A1. Generate superposition of all basis statestime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given N qubits (1 ≤ N ≤ 8) in zero state . Your task is to generate an equal superposition of all 2N basis vectors on N qubits:For example, for N = 1, the required state is simply , for N = 2, the required state is . You have to implement an operation which takes an array of N qubits as an input and has no output. The "output" of the operation is the state in which it leaves the qubits.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : ()    {        body        {            // your code here        }    }     *800
