A4. Generate W statetime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given N = 2k qubits (0 ≤ k ≤ 4) in zero state . Your task is to create a generalized W state on them. Generalized W state is an equal superposition of all basis states on N qubits that have Hamming weight equal to 1:For example, for N = 1, .You have to implement an operation which takes an array of N qubits as an input and has no output. The "output" of the operation is the state in which it leaves the qubits.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : ()    {        body        {            // your code here        }    }     *1900
