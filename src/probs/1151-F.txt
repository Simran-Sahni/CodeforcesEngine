F. Sonya and Informaticstime 1 secondmemory 256 A girl named Sonya is studying in the scientific lyceum of the Kingdom of Kremland. The teacher of computer science (Sonya's favorite subject!) invented a task for her.Given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of the numbers $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$, and the number $$$k$$$. Exactly $$$k$$$ times the following happens:   Two numbers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ are chosen equiprobable such that ($$$1 \leq i < j \leq n$$$).  The numbers in the $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ positions are swapped. Sonya's task is to find the probability that after all the operations are completed, the $$$a$$$ array will be sorted in non-decreasing order. She turned to you for help. Help Sonya solve this problem.It can be shown that the desired probability is either $$$0$$$ or it can be represented as $$$\dfrac{P}{Q}$$$, where $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ are coprime integers and $$$Q \not\equiv 0~\pmod {10^9+7}$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 100, 1 \leq k \leq 10^9$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the number of operations.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 1$$$) — the description of the array $$$a$$$.OutputIf the desired probability is $$$0$$$, print $$$0$$$, otherwise print the value $$$P \cdot Q^{-1}$$$ $$$\pmod {10^9+7}$$$, where $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ are defined above.     combinatorics      dp      matrices      probabilities      *2300
