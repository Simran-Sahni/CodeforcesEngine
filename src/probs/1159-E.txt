E. Permutation recoverytime 1 secondmemory 256 Vasya has written some permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, so for all $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$ it is true that $$$1 \leq p_i \leq n$$$ and all $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ are different. After that he wrote $$$n$$$ numbers $$$next_1, next_2, \ldots, next_n$$$. The number $$$next_i$$$ is equal to the minimal index $$$i < j \leq n$$$, such that $$$p_j > p_i$$$. If there is no such $$$j$$$ let's let's define as $$$next_i = n + 1$$$.In the evening Vasya went home from school and due to rain, his notebook got wet. Now it is impossible to read some written numbers. Permutation and some values $$$next_i$$$ are completely lost! If for some $$$i$$$ the value $$$next_i$$$ is lost, let's say that $$$next_i = -1$$$.You are given numbers $$$next_1, next_2, \ldots, next_n$$$ (maybe some of them are equal to $$$-1$$$). Help Vasya to find such permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, that he can write it to the notebook and all numbers $$$next_i$$$, which are not equal to $$$-1$$$, will be correct. InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ — the number of test cases ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100\,000$$$).Next $$$2 \cdot t$$$ lines contains the description of test cases,two lines for each. The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ — the length of the permutation, written by Vasya ($$$1 \leq n \leq 500\,000$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$next_1, next_2, \ldots, next_n$$$, separated by spaces ($$$next_i = -1$$$ or $$$i < next_i \leq n + 1$$$).It is guaranteed, that the sum of $$$n$$$ in all test cases doesn't exceed $$$500\,000$$$.In hacks you can only use one test case, so $$$T = 1$$$.OutputPrint $$$T$$$ lines, in $$$i$$$-th of them answer to the $$$i$$$-th test case.If there is no such permutations $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, that Vasya could write, print the only number $$$-1$$$.In the other case print $$$n$$$ different integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$, separated by spaces ($$$1 \leq p_i \leq n$$$). All defined values of $$$next_i$$$ which are not equal to $$$-1$$$ should be computed correctly $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ using defenition given in the statement of the problem. If there exists more than one solution you can find any of them     data structures      dfs and similar      graphs      math      *2100
