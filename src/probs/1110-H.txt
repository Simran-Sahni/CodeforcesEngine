H. Modest Substringstime 5  1024 You are given two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$.Let's call an integer $$$x$$$ modest, if $$$l \le x \le r$$$.Find a string of length $$$n$$$, consisting of digits, which has the largest possible number of substrings, which make a modest integer. Substring having leading zeros are not counted. If there are many answers, find lexicographically smallest one.If some number occurs multiple times as a substring, then in the counting of the number of modest substrings it is counted multiple times as well.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$l$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le 10^{800}$$$).The second line contains one integer $$$r$$$ ($$$l \le r \le 10^{800}$$$).The third line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2\,000$$$).OutputIn the first line, print the maximum possible number of modest substrings.In the second line, print a string of length $$$n$$$ having exactly that number of modest substrings.If there are multiple such strings, print the lexicographically smallest of them.     dp      strings      *3500
