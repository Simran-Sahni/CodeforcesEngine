E. Segments on the Linetime 2  256 You are a given a list of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ and $$$s$$$ of its segments $$$[l_j; r_j]$$$ (where $$$1 \le l_j \le r_j \le n$$$).You need to select exactly $$$m$$$ segments in such a way that the $$$k$$$-th order statistic of the multiset of $$$a_i$$$, where $$$i$$$ is contained in at least one segment, is the smallest possible. If it's impossible to select a set of $$$m$$$ segments in such a way that the multiset contains at least $$$k$$$ elements, print -1.The $$$k$$$-th order statistic of a multiset is the value of the $$$k$$$-th element after sorting the multiset in non-descending order.InputThe first line contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$s$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le m \le s \le 1500$$$, $$$1 \le k \le n \le 1500$$$) — the size of the list, the number of segments, the number of segments to choose and the statistic number.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the values of the numbers in the list.Each of the next $$$s$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$$$) — the endpoints of the segments.It is possible that some segments coincide.OutputPrint exactly one integer — the smallest possible $$$k$$$-th order statistic, or -1 if it's impossible to choose segments in a way that the multiset contains at least $$$k$$$ elements.     binary search      dp      *2500
