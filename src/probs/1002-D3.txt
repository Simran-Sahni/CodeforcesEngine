D3. Oracle for majority functiontime 1 secondmemory 256 Implement a quantum oracle on 3 qubits which implements a majority function. Majority function on 3-bit vectors is defined as follows:  if vector  has two or three 1s, and 0 if it has zero or one 1s.For an explanation on how this type of quantum oracles works, see Introduction to quantum oracles.You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs: an array of 3 qubits x in arbitrary state (input register), a qubit y in arbitrary state (output qubit).The operation doesn't have an output; its "output" is the state in which it leaves the qubits.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;    operation Solve (x : Qubit[], y : Qubit) : ()    {        body        {            // your code here        }    }     *1600
