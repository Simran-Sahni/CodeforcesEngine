A. Tanya and Stairwaystime 1 secondmemory 256 Little girl Tanya climbs the stairs inside a multi-storey building. Every time Tanya climbs a stairway, she starts counting steps from $$$1$$$ to the number of steps in this stairway. She speaks every number aloud. For example, if she climbs two stairways, the first of which contains $$$3$$$ steps, and the second contains $$$4$$$ steps, she will pronounce the numbers $$$1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4$$$.You are given all the numbers pronounced by Tanya. How many stairways did she climb? Also, output the number of steps in each stairway.The given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.InputThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 1000$$$) — the total number of numbers pronounced by Tanya.The second line contains integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 1000$$$) — all the numbers Tanya pronounced while climbing the stairs, in order from the first to the last pronounced number. Passing a stairway with $$$x$$$ steps, she will pronounce the numbers $$$1, 2, \dots, x$$$ in that order.The given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.OutputIn the first line, output $$$t$$$ — the number of stairways that Tanya climbed. In the second line, output $$$t$$$ numbers — the number of steps in each stairway she climbed. Write the numbers in the correct order of passage of the stairways.     implementation      *800
