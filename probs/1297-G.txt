G. M-numberstime 3  256 For a given positive integer $$$m$$$, a positive number is called a $$$m$$$-number if the product of its digits is $$$m$$$. For example, the beginning of a series of $$$24$$$-numbers are as follows: $$$38$$$, $$$46$$$, $$$64$$$, $$$83$$$, $$$138$$$, $$$146$$$, $$$164$$$, $$$183$$$, $$$226$$$ ...You are given a positive integer $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$. Print $$$k$$$-th among $$$m$$$-numbers if all $$$m$$$-numbers are sorted in ascending order.InputA single line of input contains two integers $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le m \le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \le k \le 10^9$$$).OutputPrint the desired number — $$$k$$$-th among all $$$m$$$-numbers if $$$m$$$-numbers are sorted in ascending order. If the answer does not exist, print -1.     *special problem      dp      math
