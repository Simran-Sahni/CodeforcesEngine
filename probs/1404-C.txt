C. Fixed Point Removaltime 4  256 Let $$$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$ be an array of $$$n$$$ positive integers. In one operation, you can choose an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$a_i = i$$$, and remove $$$a_i$$$ from the array (after the removal, the remaining parts are concatenated).The weight of $$$a$$$ is defined as the maximum number of elements you can remove.You must answer $$$q$$$ independent queries $$$(x, y)$$$: after replacing the $$$x$$$ first elements of $$$a$$$ and the $$$y$$$ last elements of $$$a$$$ by $$$n+1$$$ (making them impossible to remove), what would be the weight of $$$a$$$?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$)  — the length of the array and the number of queries.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$) — elements of the array.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$x, y \ge 0$$$ and $$$x+y < n$$$).OutputPrint $$$q$$$ lines, $$$i$$$-th line should contain a single integer  — the answer to the $$$i$$$-th query.     binary search      constructive algorithms      data structures      greedy      two pointers      *2300
