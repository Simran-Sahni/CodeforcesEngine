C. Fadi and LCMtime 1 secondmemory 256 Today, Osama gave Fadi an integer $$$X$$$, and Fadi was wondering about the minimum possible value of $$$max(a, b)$$$ such that $$$LCM(a, b)$$$ equals $$$X$$$. Both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ should be positive integers.$$$LCM(a, b)$$$ is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. For example, $$$LCM(6, 8) = 24$$$, $$$LCM(4, 12) = 12$$$, $$$LCM(2, 3) = 6$$$.Of course, Fadi immediately knew the answer. Can you be just like Fadi and find any such pair?InputThe first and only line contains an integer $$$X$$$ ($$$1 \le X \le 10^{12}$$$).OutputPrint two positive integers, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, such that the value of $$$max(a, b)$$$ is minimum possible and $$$LCM(a, b)$$$ equals $$$X$$$. If there are several possible such pairs, you can print any.     brute force      math      number theory      *1400
