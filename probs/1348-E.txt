E. Phoenix and Berriestime 2  256 Phoenix is picking berries in his backyard. There are $$$n$$$ shrubs, and each shrub has $$$a_i$$$ red berries and $$$b_i$$$ blue berries.Each basket can contain $$$k$$$ berries. But, Phoenix has decided that each basket may only contain berries from the same shrub or berries of the same color (red or blue). In other words, all berries in a basket must be from the same shrub or/and have the same color.For example, if there are two shrubs with $$$5$$$ red and $$$2$$$ blue berries in the first shrub and $$$2$$$ red and $$$1$$$ blue berries in the second shrub then Phoenix can fill $$$2$$$ baskets of capacity $$$4$$$ completely:   the first basket will contain $$$3$$$ red and $$$1$$$ blue berries from the first shrub;  the second basket will contain the $$$2$$$ remaining red berries from the first shrub and $$$2$$$ red berries from the second shrub. Help Phoenix determine the maximum number of baskets he can fill completely!InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$ 1\le n, k \le 500$$$) — the number of shrubs and the basket capacity, respectively.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i, b_i \le 10^9$$$) — the number of red and blue berries in the $$$i$$$-th shrub, respectively.OutputOutput one integer — the maximum number of baskets that Phoenix can fill completely.     brute force      dp      greedy      math      *2400
