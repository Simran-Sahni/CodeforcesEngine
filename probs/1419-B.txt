B. Stairstime 1 secondmemory 256 Jett is tired after destroying the town and she wants to have a rest. She likes high places, that's why for having a rest she wants to get high and she decided to craft staircases.A staircase is a squared figure that consists of square cells. Each staircase consists of an arbitrary number of stairs. If a staircase has $$$n$$$ stairs, then it is made of $$$n$$$ columns, the first column is $$$1$$$ cell high, the second column is $$$2$$$ cells high, $$$\ldots$$$, the $$$n$$$-th column if $$$n$$$ cells high. The lowest cells of all stairs must be in the same row.A staircase with $$$n$$$ stairs is called nice, if it may be covered by $$$n$$$ disjoint squares made of cells. All squares should fully consist of cells of a staircase. This is how a nice covered staircase with $$$7$$$ stairs looks like:  Find out the maximal number of different nice staircases, that can be built, using no more than $$$x$$$ cells, in total. No cell can be used more than once.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \le t \le 1000)$$$  — the number of test cases.The description of each test case contains a single integer $$$x$$$ $$$(1 \le x \le 10^{18})$$$  — the number of cells for building staircases.OutputFor each test case output a single integer  — the number of different nice staircases, that can be built, using not more than $$$x$$$ cells, in total     brute force      constructive algorithms      greedy      implementation      math      *1200
