B. Subsequence Hatetime 1 secondmemory 256 Shubham has a binary string $$$s$$$. A binary string is a string containing only characters "0" and "1".He can perform the following operation on the string any amount of times:   Select an index of the string, and flip the character at that index. This means, if the character was "0", it becomes "1", and vice versa. A string is called good if it does not contain "010" or "101" as a subsequence  — for instance, "1001" contains "101" as a subsequence, hence it is not a good string, while "1000" doesn't contain neither "010" nor "101" as subsequences, so it is a good string.What is the minimum number of operations he will have to perform, so that the string becomes good? It can be shown that with these operations we can make any string good.A string $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1\le t \le 100)$$$ — the number of test cases.Each of the next $$$t$$$ lines contains a binary string $$$s$$$ $$$(1 \le |s| \le 1000)$$$.OutputFor every string, output the minimum number of operations required to make it good     implementation      strings      *1400
