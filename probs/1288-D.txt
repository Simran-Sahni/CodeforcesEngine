D. Minimax Problemtime 5  512 You are given $$$n$$$ arrays $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$; each array consists of exactly $$$m$$$ integers. We denote the $$$y$$$-th element of the $$$x$$$-th array as $$$a_{x, y}$$$.You have to choose two arrays $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ ($$$1 \le i, j \le n$$$, it is possible that $$$i = j$$$). After that, you will obtain a new array $$$b$$$ consisting of $$$m$$$ integers, such that for every $$$k \in [1, m]$$$ $$$b_k = \max(a_{i, k}, a_{j, k})$$$.Your goal is to choose $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ so that the value of $$$\min \limits_{k = 1}^{m} b_k$$$ is maximum possible.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le m \le 8$$$) — the number of arrays and the number of elements in each array, respectively.Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$x$$$-th line contains the array $$$a_x$$$ represented by $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{x, 1}$$$, $$$a_{x, 2}$$$, ..., $$$a_{x, m}$$$ ($$$0 \le a_{x, y} \le 10^9$$$).OutputPrint two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le i, j \le n$$$, it is possible that $$$i = j$$$) — the indices of the two arrays you have to choose so that the value of $$$\min \limits_{k = 1}^{m} b_k$$$ is maximum possible.
