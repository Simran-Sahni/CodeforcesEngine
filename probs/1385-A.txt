A. Three Pairwise Maximumstime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given three positive (i.e. strictly greater than zero) integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ and $$$z$$$.Your task is to find positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ such that $$$x = \max(a, b)$$$, $$$y = \max(a, c)$$$ and $$$z = \max(b, c)$$$, or determine that it is impossible to find such $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases. Print required $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ in any (arbitrary) order.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The only line of the test case contains three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ ($$$1 \le x, y, z \le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer:  "NO" in the only line of the output if a solution doesn't exist;  or "YES" in the first line and any valid triple of positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b, c \le 10^9$$$) in the second line. You can print $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ in any order.     math      *800
