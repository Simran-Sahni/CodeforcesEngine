B. Big Vovatime 1 secondmemory 256 Alexander is a well-known programmer. Today he decided to finally go out and play football, but with the first hit he left a dent on the new Rolls-Royce of the wealthy businessman Big Vova. Vladimir has recently opened a store on the popular online marketplace "Zmey-Gorynych", and offers Alex a job: if he shows his programming skills by solving a task, he'll work as a cybersecurity specialist. Otherwise, he'll be delivering some doubtful products for the next two years.You're given $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$. Using each of them exactly at once, you're to make such sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$$$ that sequence $$$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$$$ is lexicographically maximal, where $$$c_i=GCD(b_1,\dots,b_i)$$$ - the greatest common divisor of the first $$$i$$$ elements of $$$b$$$. Alexander is really afraid of the conditions of this simple task, so he asks you to solve it.A sequence $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a sequence $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds: $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \ne b$$$; in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the sequence $$$a$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$b$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^3$$$)  — the length of the sequence $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^3$$$)  — the sequence $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^3$$$.OutputFor each test case output the answer in a single line  — the desired sequence $$$b$$$.
