B. Omkar and Last Class of Mathtime 1 secondmemory 256 In Omkar's last class of math, he learned about the least common multiple, or $$$LCM$$$. $$$LCM(a, b)$$$ is the smallest positive integer $$$x$$$ which is divisible by both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.Omkar, having a laudably curious mind, immediately thought of a problem involving the $$$LCM$$$ operation: given an integer $$$n$$$, find positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ such that $$$a + b = n$$$ and $$$LCM(a, b)$$$ is the minimum value possible.Can you help Omkar solve his ludicrously challenging math problem?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10$$$). Description of the test cases follows.Each test case consists of a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 10^{9}$$$).OutputFor each test case, output two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, such that $$$a + b = n$$$ and $$$LCM(a, b)$$$ is the minimum possible     greedy      math      number theory      *1300
