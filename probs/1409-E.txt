E. Two Platformstime 2  256 There are $$$n$$$ points on a plane. The $$$i$$$-th point has coordinates $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$. You have two horizontal platforms, both of length $$$k$$$. Each platform can be placed anywhere on a plane but it should be placed horizontally (on the same $$$y$$$-coordinate) and have integer borders. If the left border of the platform is $$$(x, y)$$$ then the right border is $$$(x + k, y)$$$ and all points between borders (including borders) belong to the platform.Note that platforms can share common points (overlap) and it is not necessary to place both platforms on the same $$$y$$$-coordinate.When you place both platforms on a plane, all points start falling down decreasing their $$$y$$$-coordinate. If a point collides with some platform at some moment, the point stops and is saved. Points which never collide with any platform are lost.Your task is to find the maximum number of points you can save if you place both platforms optimally.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.For better understanding, please read the Note section below to see a picture for the first test case.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of the test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \le k \le 10^9$$$) — the number of points and the length of each platform, respectively. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \le x_i \le 10^9$$$), where $$$x_i$$$ is $$$x$$$-coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th point. The third line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n$$$ ($$$1 \le y_i \le 10^9$$$), where $$$y_i$$$ is $$$y$$$-coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th point. All points are distinct (there is no pair $$$1 \le i < j \le n$$$ such that $$$x_i = x_j$$$ and $$$y_i = y_j$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer: the maximum number of points you can save if you place both platforms optimally     binary search      dp      sortings      two pointers      *1800
