D. Minimum Euler Cycletime 2  256 You are given a complete directed graph $$$K_n$$$ with $$$n$$$ vertices: each pair of vertices $$$u \neq v$$$ in $$$K_n$$$ have both directed edges $$$(u, v)$$$ and $$$(v, u)$$$; there are no self-loops.You should find such a cycle in $$$K_n$$$ that visits every directed edge exactly once (allowing for revisiting vertices).We can write such cycle as a list of $$$n(n - 1) + 1$$$ vertices $$$v_1, v_2, v_3, \dots, v_{n(n - 1) - 1}, v_{n(n - 1)}, v_{n(n - 1) + 1} = v_1$$$ — a visiting order, where each $$$(v_i, v_{i + 1})$$$ occurs exactly once.Find the lexicographically smallest such cycle. It's not hard to prove that the cycle always exists.Since the answer can be too large print its $$$[l, r]$$$ segment, in other words, $$$v_l, v_{l + 1}, \dots, v_r$$$.InputThe first line contains the single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \le T \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.Next $$$T$$$ lines contain test cases — one per line. The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le l \le r \le n(n - 1) + 1$$$, $$$r - l + 1 \le 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in $$$K_n$$$, and segment of the cycle to print.It's guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$ and the total sum of $$$r - l + 1$$$ doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print the segment $$$v_l, v_{l + 1}, \dots, v_r$$$ of the lexicographically smallest cycle that visits every edge exactly once     constructive algorithms      graphs      greedy      implementation      *1800
