E. Necklace Assemblytime 2  256 The store sells $$$n$$$ beads. The color of each bead is described by a lowercase letter of the English alphabet ("a"–"z"). You want to buy some beads to assemble a necklace from them.A necklace is a set of beads connected in a circle.For example, if the store sells beads "a", "b", "c", "a", "c", "c", then you can assemble the following necklaces (these are not all possible options):  And the following necklaces cannot be assembled from beads sold in the store:  The first necklace cannot be assembled because it has three beads "a" (of the two available). The second necklace cannot be assembled because it contains a bead "d", which is not sold in the store. We call a necklace $$$k$$$-beautiful if, when it is turned clockwise by $$$k$$$ beads, the necklace remains unchanged. For example, here is a sequence of three turns of a necklace.    As you can see, this necklace is, for example, $$$3$$$-beautiful, $$$6$$$-beautiful, $$$9$$$-beautiful, and so on, but it is not $$$1$$$-beautiful or $$$2$$$-beautiful.In particular, a necklace of length $$$1$$$ is $$$k$$$-beautiful for any integer $$$k$$$. A necklace that consists of beads of the same color is also beautiful for any $$$k$$$.You are given the integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$, and also the string $$$s$$$ containing $$$n$$$ lowercase letters of the English alphabet — each letter defines a bead in the store. You can buy any subset of beads and connect them in any order. Find the maximum length of a $$$k$$$-beautiful necklace you can assemble.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases in the test. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n, k \le 2000$$$).The second line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ containing $$$n$$$ lowercase English letters — the beads in the store.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$.OutputOutput $$$t$$$ answers to the test cases. Each answer is a positive integer — the maximum length of the $$$k$$$-beautiful necklace you can assemble     brute force      dfs and similar      dp      graphs      greedy      number theory      *1900
