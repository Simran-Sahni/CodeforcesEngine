F. Keep talking and nobody explodes â€“ easytime 2  256 This is an unusual problem in an unusual contest, here is the announcement: http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/73543You have the safe lock which consists of 5 decimal digits. If you rotate some digit, it increases by one, except 9 which becomes 0.Initially, the lock contains number $$$x$$$. To unlock the safe you must do the following operations in order (and be careful, don't mix up if and else statements).If sum of digits on positions 1 and 4 is greater than 10, rotate digit on position 1 by 3 times, else rotate digit on position 4 by 8 times.If sum of digits on positions 3 and 2 is greater than 8, rotate digit on position 4 by 9 times, else rotate digit on position 5 by 8 times.If digit on position 3 is odd, rotate digit on position 3 by 3 times, else rotate digit on position 3 by 4 times.If digit on position 5 is greater than digit on position 2, rotate digit on position 4 by 1 times, else rotate digit on position 2 by 7 times.If digit on position 1 is odd, rotate digit on position 1 by 3 times, else rotate digit on position 3 by 5 times.If digit on position 4 is odd, rotate digit on position 4 by 7 times, else rotate digit on position 1 by 9 times.If digit on position 4 is greater than digit on position 1, rotate digit on position 4 by 9 times, else rotate digit on position 4 by 2 times.If digit on position 1 is greater than digit on position 3, rotate digit on position 2 by 1 times, else rotate digit on position 3 by 1 times.If digit on position 5 is greater than digit on position 3, rotate digit on position 4 by 5 times, else rotate digit on position 5 by 8 times.If sum of digits on positions 1 and 3 is greater than 8, rotate digit on position 4 by 5 times, else rotate digit on position 2 by 5 times.If digit on position 1 is greater than digit on position 4, rotate digit on position 4 by 3 times, else rotate digit on position 2 by 3 times.If sum of digits on positions 3 and 1 is greater than 9, rotate digit on position 2 by 9 times, else rotate digit on position 2 by 2 times.If sum of digits on positions 4 and 3 is greater than 10, rotate digit on position 4 by 7 times, else rotate digit on position 5 by 7 times.If digit on position 3 is greater than digit on position 2, rotate digit on position 3 by 2 times, else rotate digit on position 4 by 6 times.If digit on position 1 is greater than digit on position 3, rotate digit on position 1 by 9 times, else rotate digit on position 2 by 9 times.If digit on position 3 is odd, rotate digit on position 3 by 9 times, else rotate digit on position 1 by 5 times.If sum of digits on positions 3 and 5 is greater than 9, rotate digit on position 3 by 4 times, else rotate digit on position 3 by 9 times.If digit on position 3 is greater than digit on position 1, rotate digit on position 5 by 1 times, else rotate digit on position 5 by 7 times.If digit on position 1 is greater than digit on position 3, rotate digit on position 2 by 9 times, else rotate digit on position 4 by 6 times.If sum of digits on positions 2 and 3 is greater than 10, rotate digit on position 2 by 2 times, else rotate digit on position 3 by 6 times.InputInput contains single number $$$x$$$ consisting of exactly 5 digits, leading zeroes are allowed.OutputOutput the number after applying all operations.     bitmasks      brute force      expression parsing
