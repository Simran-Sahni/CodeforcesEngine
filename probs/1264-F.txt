F. Beautiful Fibonacci Problemtime 1 secondmemory 256 The well-known Fibonacci sequence $$$F_0, F_1, F_2,\ldots $$$ is defined as follows:   $$$F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1$$$.  For each $$$i \geq 2$$$: $$$F_i = F_{i - 1} + F_{i - 2}$$$. Given an increasing arithmetic sequence of positive integers with $$$n$$$ elements: $$$(a, a + d, a + 2\cdot d,\ldots, a + (n - 1)\cdot d)$$$.You need to find another increasing arithmetic sequence of positive integers with $$$n$$$ elements $$$(b, b + e, b + 2\cdot e,\ldots, b + (n - 1)\cdot e)$$$ such that:  $$$0 < b, e < 2^{64}$$$,  for all $$$0\leq i < n$$$, the decimal representation of $$$a + i \cdot d$$$ appears as substring in the last $$$18$$$ digits of the decimal representation of $$$F_{b + i \cdot e}$$$ (if this number has less than $$$18$$$ digits, then we consider all its digits). InputThe first line contains three positive integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, a, d, a + (n - 1) \cdot d < 10^6$$$).OutputIf no such arithmetic sequence exists, print $$$-1$$$.Otherwise, print two integers $$$b$$$ and $$$e$$$, separated by space in a single line ($$$0 < b, e < 2^{64}$$$).If there are many answers, you can output any of them.     constructive algorithms      number theory      *3500
