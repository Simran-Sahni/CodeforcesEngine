H. Kuroni the Private Tutortime 3  256 As a professional private tutor, Kuroni has to gather statistics of an exam. Kuroni has appointed you to complete this important task. You must not disappoint him.The exam consists of $$$n$$$ questions, and $$$m$$$ students have taken the exam. Each question was worth $$$1$$$ point. Question $$$i$$$ was solved by at least $$$l_i$$$ and at most $$$r_i$$$ students. Additionally, you know that the total score of all students is $$$t$$$.Furthermore, you took a glance at the final ranklist of the quiz. The students were ranked from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$, where rank $$$1$$$ has the highest score and rank $$$m$$$ has the lowest score. Ties were broken arbitrarily.You know that the student at rank $$$p_i$$$ had a score of $$$s_i$$$ for $$$1 \le i \le q$$$.You wonder if there could have been a huge tie for first place. Help Kuroni determine the maximum number of students who could have gotten as many points as the student with rank $$$1$$$, and the maximum possible score for rank $$$1$$$ achieving this maximum number of students.InputThe first line of input contains two integers ($$$1 \le n, m \le 10^{5}$$$), denoting the number of questions of the exam and the number of students respectively.The next $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers each, with the $$$i$$$-th line containing $$$l_{i}$$$ and $$$r_{i}$$$ ($$$0 \le l_{i} \le r_{i} \le m$$$).The next line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$0 \le q \le m$$$). The next $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers each, denoting $$$p_{i}$$$ and $$$s_{i}$$$ ($$$1 \le p_{i} \le m$$$, $$$0 \le s_{i} \le n$$$). It is guaranteed that all $$$p_{i}$$$ are distinct and if $$$p_{i} \le p_{j}$$$, then $$$s_{i} \ge s_{j}$$$.The last line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$0 \le t \le nm$$$), denoting the total score of all students.OutputOutput two integers: the maximum number of students who could have gotten as many points as the student with rank $$$1$$$, and the maximum possible score for rank $$$1$$$ achieving this maximum number of students. If there is no valid arrangement that fits the given data, output $$$-1$$$ $$$-1$$$.     binary search      greedy      *3500
