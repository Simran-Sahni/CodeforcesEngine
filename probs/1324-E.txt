E. Sleeping Scheduletime 2  256 Vova had a pretty weird sleeping schedule. There are $$$h$$$ hours in a day. Vova will sleep exactly $$$n$$$ times. The $$$i$$$-th time he will sleep exactly after $$$a_i$$$ hours from the time he woke up. You can assume that Vova woke up exactly at the beginning of this story (the initial time is $$$0$$$). Each time Vova sleeps exactly one day (in other words, $$$h$$$ hours).Vova thinks that the $$$i$$$-th sleeping time is good if he starts to sleep between hours $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ inclusive.Vova can control himself and before the $$$i$$$-th time can choose between two options: go to sleep after $$$a_i$$$ hours or after $$$a_i - 1$$$ hours.Your task is to say the maximum number of good sleeping times Vova can obtain if he acts optimally.InputThe first line of the input contains four integers $$$n, h, l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2000, 3 \le h \le 2000, 0 \le l \le r < h$$$) — the number of times Vova goes to sleep, the number of hours in a day and the segment of the good sleeping time.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i < h$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the number of hours after which Vova goes to sleep the $$$i$$$-th time.OutputPrint one integer — the maximum number of good sleeping times Vova can obtain if he acts optimally     dp      implementation      *1700
