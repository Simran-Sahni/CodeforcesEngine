E. Array Shrinkingtime 2  256 You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$. You can perform the following operation any number of times:  Choose a pair of two neighboring equal elements $$$a_i = a_{i + 1}$$$ (if there is at least one such pair).  Replace them by one element with value $$$a_i + 1$$$. After each such operation, the length of the array will decrease by one (and elements are renumerated accordingly). What is the minimum possible length of the array $$$a$$$ you can get?InputThe first line contains the single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 500$$$) — the initial length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 1000$$$) — the initial array $$$a$$$.OutputPrint the only integer — the minimum possible length you can get after performing the operation described above any number of times.     dp      greedy      *2100
