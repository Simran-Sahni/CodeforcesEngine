D2. Wrong Answer on test 233 (Hard Version)time 1 secondmemory 256 Your program fails again. This time it gets "Wrong answer on test 233".This is the harder version of the problem. In this version, $$$1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5$$$. You can hack this problem if you locked it. But you can hack the previous problem only if you locked both problems.The problem is to finish $$$n$$$ one-choice-questions. Each of the questions contains $$$k$$$ options, and only one of them is correct. The answer to the $$$i$$$-th question is $$$h_{i}$$$, and if your answer of the question $$$i$$$ is $$$h_{i}$$$, you earn $$$1$$$ point, otherwise, you earn $$$0$$$ points for this question. The values $$$h_1, h_2, \dots, h_n$$$ are known to you in this problem.However, you have a mistake in your program. It moves the answer clockwise! Consider all the $$$n$$$ answers are written in a circle. Due to the mistake in your program, they are shifted by one cyclically.Formally, the mistake moves the answer for the question $$$i$$$ to the question $$$i \bmod n + 1$$$. So it moves the answer for the question $$$1$$$ to question $$$2$$$, the answer for the question $$$2$$$ to the question $$$3$$$, ..., the answer for the question $$$n$$$ to the question $$$1$$$.We call all the $$$n$$$ answers together an answer suit. There are $$$k^n$$$ possible answer suits in total.You're wondering, how many answer suits satisfy the following condition: after moving clockwise by $$$1$$$, the total number of points of the new answer suit is strictly larger than the number of points of the old one. You need to find the answer modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and your answer suit is $$$a=[1,2,3,4,5]$$$, it will submitted as $$$a'=[5,1,2,3,4]$$$ because of a mistake. If the correct answer suit is $$$h=[5,2,2,3,4]$$$, the answer suit $$$a$$$ earns $$$1$$$ point and the answer suite $$$a'$$$ earns $$$4$$$ points. Since $$$4 > 1$$$, the answer suit $$$a=[1,2,3,4,5]$$$ should be counted.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5$$$, $$$1 \le k \le 10^9$$$) — the number of questions and the number of possible answers to each question.The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \dots, h_n$$$, ($$$1 \le h_{i} \le k)$$$ — answers to the questions.OutputOutput one integer: the number of answers suits satisfying the given condition, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.     combinatorics      fft      math      number theory      *2400
