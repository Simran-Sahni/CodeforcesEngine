D. Decrease the Sum of Digitstime 2  256 You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$. In one move, you can increase $$$n$$$ by one (i.e. make $$$n := n + 1$$$). Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to perform in order to make the sum of digits of $$$n$$$ be less than or equal to $$$s$$$.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The only line of the test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^{18}$$$; $$$1 \le s \le 162$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of moves you need to perform in order to make the sum of digits of $$$n$$$ be less than or equal to $$$s$$$     greedy      math      *1500
