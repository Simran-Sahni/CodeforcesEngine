F. x-prime Substringstime 2  256 You are given an integer value $$$x$$$ and a string $$$s$$$ consisting of digits from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ inclusive.A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string.Let $$$f(l, r)$$$ be the sum of digits of a substring $$$s[l..r]$$$.Let's call substring $$$s[l_1..r_1]$$$ $$$x$$$-prime if   $$$f(l_1, r_1) = x$$$;  there are no values $$$l_2, r_2$$$ such that   $$$l_1 \le l_2 \le r_2 \le r_1$$$;  $$$f(l_2, r_2) \neq x$$$;  $$$x$$$ is divisible by $$$f(l_2, r_2)$$$.  You are allowed to erase some characters from the string. If you erase a character, the two resulting parts of the string are concatenated without changing their order.What is the minimum number of characters you should erase from the string so that there are no $$$x$$$-prime substrings in it? If there are no $$$x$$$-prime substrings in the given string $$$s$$$, then print $$$0$$$.InputThe first line contains a string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le 1000$$$). $$$s$$$ contains only digits from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ inclusive.The second line contains an integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le x \le 20$$$).OutputPrint a single integer — the minimum number of characters you should erase from the string so that there are no $$$x$$$-prime substrings in it. If there are no $$$x$$$-prime substrings in the given string $$$s$$$, then print $$$0$$$.     brute force      dfs and similar      dp      string suffix structures      strings      *2800
