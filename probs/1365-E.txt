E. Maximum Subsequence Valuetime 2  256 Ridhiman challenged Ashish to find the maximum valued subsequence of an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ consisting of positive integers. The value of a non-empty subsequence of $$$k$$$ elements of $$$a$$$ is defined as $$$\sum 2^i$$$ over all integers $$$i \ge 0$$$ such that at least $$$\max(1, k - 2)$$$ elements of the subsequence have the $$$i$$$-th bit set in their binary representation (value $$$x$$$ has the $$$i$$$-th bit set in its binary representation if $$$\lfloor \frac{x}{2^i} \rfloor \mod 2$$$ is equal to $$$1$$$). Recall that $$$b$$$ is a subsequence of $$$a$$$, if $$$b$$$ can be obtained by deleting some(possibly zero) elements from $$$a$$$.Help Ashish find the maximum value he can get by choosing some subsequence of $$$a$$$.InputThe first line of the input consists of a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \le n \le 500)$$$ — the size of $$$a$$$.The next line consists of $$$n$$$ space-separated integers — the elements of the array $$$(1 \le a_i \le 10^{18})$$$.OutputPrint a single integer — the maximum value Ashish can get by choosing some subsequence of $$$a$$$.     brute force      constructive algorithms      *1900
