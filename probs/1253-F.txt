F. Cheap Robottime 3  512 You're given a simple, undirected, connected, weighted graph with $$$n$$$ nodes and $$$m$$$ edges.Nodes are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. There are exactly $$$k$$$ centrals (recharge points), which are nodes $$$1, 2, \ldots, k$$$.We consider a robot moving into this graph, with a battery of capacity $$$c$$$, not fixed by the constructor yet. At any time, the battery contains an integer amount $$$x$$$ of energy between $$$0$$$ and $$$c$$$ inclusive.Traversing an edge of weight $$$w_i$$$ is possible only if $$$x \ge w_i$$$, and costs $$$w_i$$$ energy points ($$$x := x - w_i$$$).Moreover, when the robot reaches a central, its battery is entirely recharged ($$$x := c$$$).You're given $$$q$$$ independent missions, the $$$i$$$-th mission requires to move the robot from central $$$a_i$$$ to central $$$b_i$$$.For each mission, you should tell the minimum capacity required to acheive it.InputThe first line contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \le k \le n \le 10^5$$$ and $$$1 \le m, q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$).The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$ and $$$w_i$$$ ($$$1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$$$, $$$u_i \neq v_i$$$, $$$1 \le w_i \le 10^9$$$), that mean that there's an edge between nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, with a weight $$$w_i$$$.It is guaranteed that the given graph is simple (there is no self-loop, and there is at most one edge between every pair of nodes) and connected.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i, b_i \le k$$$, $$$a_i \neq b_i$$$).OutputYou have to output $$$q$$$ lines, where the $$$i$$$-th line contains a single integer : the minimum capacity required to acheive the $$$i$$$-th mission.     binary search      dsu      graphs      shortest paths      trees      *2500
