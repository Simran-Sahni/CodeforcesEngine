C. Cyclic Permutations time 1 secondmemory 256 A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).Consider a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$, we build a graph of size $$$n$$$ using it as follows:   For every $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$, find the largest $$$j$$$ such that $$$1 \leq j < i$$$ and $$$p_j > p_i$$$, and add an undirected edge between node $$$i$$$ and node $$$j$$$  For every $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$, find the smallest $$$j$$$ such that $$$i < j \leq n$$$ and $$$p_j > p_i$$$, and add an undirected edge between node $$$i$$$ and node $$$j$$$ In cases where no such $$$j$$$ exists, we make no edges. Also, note that we make edges between the corresponding indices, not the values at those indices.For clarity, consider as an example $$$n = 4$$$, and $$$p = [3,1,4,2]$$$; here, the edges of the graph are $$$(1,3),(2,1),(2,3),(4,3)$$$.A permutation $$$p$$$ is cyclic if the graph built using $$$p$$$ has at least one simple cycle. Given $$$n$$$, find the number of cyclic permutations of length $$$n$$$. Since the number may be very large, output it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.Please refer to the Notes section for the formal definition of a simple cycleInputThe first and only line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 10^6$$$).OutputOutput a single integer $$$0 \leq x < 10^9+7$$$, the number of cyclic permutations of length $$$n$$$ modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.     combinatorics      dp      graphs      math      *1500
