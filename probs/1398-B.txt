B. Substring Removal Gametime 2  256 Alice and Bob play a game. They have a binary string $$$s$$$ (a string such that each character in it is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$). Alice moves first, then Bob, then Alice again, and so on.During their move, the player can choose any number (not less than one) of consecutive equal characters in $$$s$$$ and delete them.For example, if the string is $$$10110$$$, there are $$$6$$$ possible moves (deleted characters are bold):  $$$\textbf{1}0110 \to 0110$$$;  $$$1\textbf{0}110 \to 1110$$$;  $$$10\textbf{1}10 \to 1010$$$;  $$$101\textbf{1}0 \to 1010$$$;  $$$10\textbf{11}0 \to 100$$$;  $$$1011\textbf{0} \to 1011$$$. After the characters are removed, the characters to the left and to the right of the removed block become adjacent. I. e. the following sequence of moves is valid: $$$10\textbf{11}0 \to 1\textbf{00} \to 1$$$.The game ends when the string becomes empty, and the score of each player is the number of $$$1$$$-characters deleted by them.Each player wants to maximize their score. Calculate the resulting score of Alice.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \le T \le 500$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case contains exactly one line containing a binary string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le 100$$$).OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the resulting score of Alice (the number of $$$1$$$-characters deleted by her)     games      greedy      sortings      *800
