A. Deadlinetime 2  256 Adilbek was assigned to a special project. For Adilbek it means that he has $$$n$$$ days to run a special program and provide its results. But there is a problem: the program needs to run for $$$d$$$ days to calculate the results.Fortunately, Adilbek can optimize the program. If he spends $$$x$$$ ($$$x$$$ is a non-negative integer) days optimizing the program, he will make the program run in $$$\left\lceil \frac{d}{x + 1} \right\rceil$$$ days ($$$\left\lceil a \right\rceil$$$ is the ceiling function: $$$\left\lceil 2.4 \right\rceil = 3$$$, $$$\left\lceil 2 \right\rceil = 2$$$). The program cannot be run and optimized simultaneously, so the total number of days he will spend is equal to $$$x + \left\lceil \frac{d}{x + 1} \right\rceil$$$.Will Adilbek be able to provide the generated results in no more than $$$n$$$ days?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \le T \le 50$$$) — the number of test cases.The next $$$T$$$ lines contain test cases – one per line. Each line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \le d \le 10^9$$$) — the number of days before the deadline and the number of days the program runs.OutputPrint $$$T$$$ answers — one per test case. For each test case print YES (case insensitive) if Adilbek can fit in $$$n$$$ days or NO (case insensitive) otherwise     binary search      brute force      math      ternary search      *1100
