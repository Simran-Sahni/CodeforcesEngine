D. Berserk And Fireballtime 2  256 There are $$$n$$$ warriors in a row. The power of the $$$i$$$-th warrior is $$$a_i$$$. All powers are pairwise distinct.You have two types of spells which you may cast:   Fireball: you spend $$$x$$$ mana and destroy exactly $$$k$$$ consecutive warriors;  Berserk: you spend $$$y$$$ mana, choose two consecutive warriors, and the warrior with greater power destroys the warrior with smaller power. For example, let the powers of warriors be $$$[2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 5, 4]$$$, and $$$k = 3$$$. If you cast Berserk on warriors with powers $$$8$$$ and $$$11$$$, the resulting sequence of powers becomes $$$[2, 3, 7, 11, 5, 4]$$$. Then, for example, if you cast Fireball on consecutive warriors with powers $$$[7, 11, 5]$$$, the resulting sequence of powers becomes $$$[2, 3, 4]$$$.You want to turn the current sequence of warriors powers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ into $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$$$. Calculate the minimum amount of mana you need to spend on it.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of sequence $$$a$$$ and the length of sequence $$$b$$$ respectively.The second line contains three integers $$$x, k, y$$$ ($$$1 \le x, y, \le 10^9; 1 \le k \le n$$$) — the cost of fireball, the range of fireball and the cost of berserk respectively.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$). It is guaranteed that all integers $$$a_i$$$ are pairwise distinct.The fourth line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le n$$$). It is guaranteed that all integers $$$b_i$$$ are pairwise distinct.OutputPrint the minimum amount of mana for turning the sequnce $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ into $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$$$, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible.     constructive algorithms      greedy      implementation      math      two pointers      *2000
