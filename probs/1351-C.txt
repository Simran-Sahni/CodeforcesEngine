C. Skiertime 1 secondmemory 256 Skier rides on a snowy field. Its movements can be described by a string of characters 'S', 'N', 'W', 'E' (which correspond to $$$1$$$ meter movement in the south, north, west or east direction respectively).It is known that if he moves along a previously unvisited segment of a path (i.e. this segment of the path is visited the first time), then the time of such movement is $$$5$$$ seconds. If he rolls along previously visited segment of a path (i.e., this segment of the path has been covered by his path before), then it takes $$$1$$$ second.Find the skier's time to roll all the path.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases in the input. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each set is given by one nonempty string of the characters 'S', 'N', 'W', 'E'. The length of the string does not exceed $$$10^5$$$ characters.The sum of the lengths of $$$t$$$ given lines over all test cases in the input does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the desired path time in seconds     data structures      implementation      *1400
