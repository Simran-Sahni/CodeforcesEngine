A. Donut Shopstime 2  256 There are two rival donut shops.The first shop sells donuts at retail: each donut costs $$$a$$$ dollars.The second shop sells donuts only in bulk: box of $$$b$$$ donuts costs $$$c$$$ dollars. So if you want to buy $$$x$$$ donuts from this shop, then you have to buy the smallest number of boxes such that the total number of donuts in them is greater or equal to $$$x$$$.You want to determine two positive integer values:   how many donuts can you buy so that they are strictly cheaper in the first shop than in the second shop?  how many donuts can you buy so that they are strictly cheaper in the second shop than in the first shop? If any of these values doesn't exist then that value should be equal to $$$-1$$$. If there are multiple possible answers, then print any of them.The printed values should be less or equal to $$$10^9$$$. It can be shown that under the given constraints such values always exist if any values exist at all.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of testcases.Each of the next $$$t$$$ lines contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \le a \le 10^9$$$, $$$2 \le b \le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \le c \le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each testcase print two positive integers. For both shops print such $$$x$$$ that buying $$$x$$$ donuts in this shop is strictly cheaper than buying $$$x$$$ donuts in the other shop. $$$x$$$ should be greater than $$$0$$$ and less or equal to $$$10^9$$$.If there is no such $$$x$$$, then print $$$-1$$$. If there are multiple answers, then print any of them     greedy      implementation      math      *1000
