F. Cyclic Shifts Sortingtime 2  256 You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers.In one move, you can choose some index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n - 2$$$) and shift the segment $$$[a_i, a_{i + 1}, a_{i + 2}]$$$ cyclically to the right (i.e. replace the segment $$$[a_i, a_{i + 1}, a_{i + 2}]$$$ with $$$[a_{i + 2}, a_i, a_{i + 1}]$$$). Your task is to sort the initial array by no more than $$$n^2$$$ such operations or say that it is impossible to do that.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 500$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 500$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$500$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the answer: -1 on the only line if it is impossible to sort the given array using operations described in the problem statement, or the number of operations $$$ans$$$ on the first line and $$$ans$$$ integers $$$idx_1, idx_2, \dots, idx_{ans}$$$ ($$$1 \le idx_i \le n - 2$$$), where $$$idx_i$$$ is the index of left border of the segment for the $$$i$$$-th operation.
