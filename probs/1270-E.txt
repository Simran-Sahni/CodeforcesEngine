E. Divide Pointstime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given a set of $$$n\ge 2$$$ pairwise different points with integer coordinates. Your task is to partition these points into two nonempty groups $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$, such that the following condition holds:For every two points $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$, write the Euclidean distance between them on the blackboard: if they belong to the same group — with a yellow pen, and if they belong to different groups — with a blue pen. Then no yellow number is equal to any blue number.It is guaranteed that such a partition exists for any possible input. If there exist multiple partitions, you are allowed to output any of them.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ $$$(2 \le n \le 10^3)$$$ — the number of points.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-10^6 \le x_i, y_i \le 10^6$$$) — the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th point. It is guaranteed that all $$$n$$$ points are pairwise different.OutputIn the first line, output $$$a$$$ ($$$1 \le a \le n-1$$$) — the number of points in a group $$$A$$$.In the second line, output $$$a$$$ integers — the indexes of points that you include into group $$$A$$$.If there are multiple answers, print any.     constructive algorithms      geometry      math      *2300
