D. Odd-Even Subsequencetime 2  256 Ashish has an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$.A subsequence of $$$a$$$ is defined as a sequence that can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by deleting some elements (possibly none), without changing the order of the remaining elements.Consider a subsequence $$$s$$$ of $$$a$$$. He defines the cost of $$$s$$$ as the minimum between:   The maximum among all elements at odd indices of $$$s$$$.  The maximum among all elements at even indices of $$$s$$$. Note that the index of an element is its index in $$$s$$$, rather than its index in $$$a$$$. The positions are numbered from $$$1$$$. So, the cost of $$$s$$$ is equal to $$$min(max(s_1, s_3, s_5, \ldots), max(s_2, s_4, s_6, \ldots))$$$.For example, the cost of $$$\{7, 5, 6\}$$$ is $$$min( max(7, 6), max(5) ) = min(7, 5) = 5$$$.Help him find the minimum cost of a subsequence of size $$$k$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$)  — the size of the array $$$a$$$ and the size of the subsequence.The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$)  — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputOutput a single integer  — the minimum cost of a subsequence of size $$$k$$$.     binary search      dp      dsu      greedy      implementation      *2000
