E. Antenna Coveragetime 3  256 The mayor of the Central Town wants to modernize Central Street, represented in this problem by the $$$(Ox)$$$ axis.On this street, there are $$$n$$$ antennas, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th antenna lies on the position $$$x_i$$$ and has an initial scope of $$$s_i$$$: it covers all integer positions inside the interval $$$[x_i - s_i; x_i + s_i]$$$.It is possible to increment the scope of any antenna by $$$1$$$, this operation costs $$$1$$$ coin. We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).To modernize the street, we need to make all integer positions from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ inclusive covered by at least one antenna. Note that it is authorized to cover positions outside $$$[1; m]$$$, even if it's not required.What is the minimum amount of coins needed to achieve this modernization?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 80$$$ and $$$n \le m \le 100\ 000$$$).The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$s_i$$$ ($$$1 \le x_i \le m$$$ and $$$0 \le s_i \le m$$$).On each position, there is at most one antenna (values $$$x_i$$$ are pairwise distinct).OutputYou have to output a single integer: the minimum amount of coins required to make all integer positions from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ inclusive covered by at least one antenna.     data structures      dp      greedy      sortings      *2200
