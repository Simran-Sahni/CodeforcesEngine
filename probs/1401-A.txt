A. Distance and Axistime 1 secondmemory 256 We have a point $$$A$$$ with coordinate $$$x = n$$$ on $$$OX$$$-axis. We'd like to find an integer point $$$B$$$ (also on $$$OX$$$-axis), such that the absolute difference between the distance from $$$O$$$ to $$$B$$$ and the distance from $$$A$$$ to $$$B$$$ is equal to $$$k$$$.  The description of the first test case. Since sometimes it's impossible to find such point $$$B$$$, we can, in one step, increase or decrease the coordinate of $$$A$$$ by $$$1$$$. What is the minimum number of steps we should do to make such point $$$B$$$ exist?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 6000$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \le n, k \le 10^6$$$) — the initial position of point $$$A$$$ and desirable absolute difference.OutputFor each test case, print the minimum number of steps to make point $$$B$$$ exist     constructive algorithms      math      *900
