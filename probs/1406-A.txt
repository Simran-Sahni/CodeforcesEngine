A. Subset Mextime 1 secondmemory 512 Given a set of integers (it can contain equal elements).You have to split it into two subsets $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ (both of them can contain equal elements or be empty). You have to maximize the value of $$$mex(A)+mex(B)$$$.Here $$$mex$$$ of a set denotes the smallest non-negative integer that doesn't exist in the set. For example:   $$$mex(\{1,4,0,2,2,1\})=3$$$  $$$mex(\{3,3,2,1,3,0,0\})=4$$$  $$$mex(\varnothing)=0$$$ ($$$mex$$$ for empty set) The set is splitted into two subsets $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ if for any integer number $$$x$$$ the number of occurrences of $$$x$$$ into this set is equal to the sum of the number of occurrences of $$$x$$$ into $$$A$$$ and the number of occurrences of $$$x$$$ into $$$B$$$.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\leq t\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\leq n\leq 100$$$) — the size of the set.The second line of each testcase contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\dots a_n$$$ ($$$0\leq a_i\leq 100$$$) — the numbers in the set.OutputFor each test case, print the maximum value of $$$mex(A)+mex(B)$$$     greedy      implementation      math      *900
