A. C+=time 2  512 Leo has developed a new programming language C+=. In C+=, integer variables can only be changed with a "+=" operation that adds the right-hand side value to the left-hand side variable. For example, performing "a += b" when a = $$$2$$$, b = $$$3$$$ changes the value of a to $$$5$$$ (the value of b does not change).In a prototype program Leo has two integer variables a and b, initialized with some positive values. He can perform any number of operations "a += b" or "b += a". Leo wants to test handling large integers, so he wants to make the value of either a or b strictly greater than a given value $$$n$$$. What is the smallest number of operations he has to perform?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \leq T \leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases.Each of the following $$$T$$$ lines describes a single test case, and contains three integers $$$a, b, n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a, b \leq n \leq 10^9$$$) — initial values of a and b, and the value one of the variables has to exceed, respectively.OutputFor each test case print a single integer — the smallest number of operations needed.
