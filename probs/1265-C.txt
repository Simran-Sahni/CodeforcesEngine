C. Beautiful Regional Contesttime 2  256 So the Beautiful Regional Contest (BeRC) has come to an end! $$$n$$$ students took part in the contest. The final standings are already known: the participant in the $$$i$$$-th place solved $$$p_i$$$ problems. Since the participants are primarily sorted by the number of solved problems, then $$$p_1 \ge p_2 \ge \dots \ge p_n$$$.Help the jury distribute the gold, silver and bronze medals. Let their numbers be $$$g$$$, $$$s$$$ and $$$b$$$, respectively. Here is a list of requirements from the rules, which all must be satisfied:  for each of the three types of medals, at least one medal must be awarded (that is, $$$g>0$$$, $$$s>0$$$ and $$$b>0$$$);  the number of gold medals must be strictly less than the number of silver and the number of bronze (that is, $$$g<s$$$ and $$$g<b$$$, but there are no requirements between $$$s$$$ and $$$b$$$);  each gold medalist must solve strictly more problems than any awarded with a silver medal;  each silver medalist must solve strictly more problems than any awarded a bronze medal;  each bronze medalist must solve strictly more problems than any participant not awarded a medal;  the total number of medalists $$$g+s+b$$$ should not exceed half of all participants (for example, if $$$n=21$$$, then you can award a maximum of $$$10$$$ participants, and if $$$n=26$$$, then you can award a maximum of $$$13$$$ participants). The jury wants to reward with medals the total maximal number participants (i.e. to maximize $$$g+s+b$$$) so that all of the items listed above are fulfilled. Help the jury find such a way to award medals.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10000$$$) — the number of test cases in the input. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of a test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 4\cdot10^5$$$) — the number of BeRC participants. The second line of a test case contains integers $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$$$ ($$$0 \le p_i \le 10^6$$$), where $$$p_i$$$ is equal to the number of problems solved by the $$$i$$$-th participant from the final standings. The values $$$p_i$$$ are sorted in non-increasing order, i.e. $$$p_1 \ge p_2 \ge \dots \ge p_n$$$.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases in the input does not exceed $$$4\cdot10^5$$$.OutputPrint $$$t$$$ lines, the $$$j$$$-th line should contain the answer to the $$$j$$$-th test case.The answer consists of three non-negative integers $$$g, s, b$$$.  Print $$$g=s=b=0$$$ if there is no way to reward participants with medals so that all requirements from the statement are satisfied at the same time.  Otherwise, print three positive numbers $$$g, s, b$$$ — the possible number of gold, silver and bronze medals, respectively. The sum of $$$g+s+b$$$ should be the maximum possible. If there are several answers, print any of them.     greedy      implementation      *1500
