F2. Median on Segments (General Case Edition)time 3  256 You are given an integer sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$.Find the number of pairs of indices $$$(l, r)$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$) such that the value of median of $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r$$$ is exactly the given number $$$m$$$.The median of a sequence is the value of an element which is in the middle of the sequence after sorting it in non-decreasing order. If the length of the sequence is even, the left of two middle elements is used.For example, if $$$a=[4, 2, 7, 5]$$$ then its median is $$$4$$$ since after sorting the sequence, it will look like $$$[2, 4, 5, 7]$$$ and the left of two middle elements is equal to $$$4$$$. The median of $$$[7, 1, 2, 9, 6]$$$ equals $$$6$$$ since after sorting, the value $$$6$$$ will be in the middle of the sequence.Write a program to find the number of pairs of indices $$$(l, r)$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$) such that the value of median of $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r$$$ is exactly the given number $$$m$$$.InputThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n,m \le 2\cdot10^5$$$) â€” the length of the given sequence and the required value of the median.The second line contains an integer sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 2\cdot10^5$$$).OutputPrint the required number.     *special problem      sortings
