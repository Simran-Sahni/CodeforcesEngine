B. Ternary Stringtime 2  256 You are given a string $$$s$$$ such that each its character is either 1, 2, or 3. You have to choose the shortest contiguous substring of $$$s$$$ such that it contains each of these three characters at least once.A contiguous substring of string $$$s$$$ is a string that can be obtained from $$$s$$$ by removing some (possibly zero) characters from the beginning of $$$s$$$ and some (possibly zero) characters from the end of $$$s$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 20000$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le 200000$$$). It is guaranteed that each character of $$$s$$$ is either 1, 2, or 3.The sum of lengths of all strings in all test cases does not exceed $$$200000$$$.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the length of the shortest contiguous substring of $$$s$$$ containing all three types of characters at least once. If there is no such substring, print $$$0$$$ instead     binary search      dp      implementation      two pointers      *1200
