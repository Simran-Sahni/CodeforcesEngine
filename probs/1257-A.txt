A. Two Rival Studentstime 1 secondmemory 256 You are the gym teacher in the school.There are $$$n$$$ students in the row. And there are two rivalling students among them. The first one is in position $$$a$$$, the second in position $$$b$$$. Positions are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right.Since they are rivals, you want to maximize the distance between them. If students are in positions $$$p$$$ and $$$s$$$ respectively, then distance between them is $$$|p - s|$$$. You can do the following operation at most $$$x$$$ times: choose two adjacent (neighbouring) students and swap them.Calculate the maximum distance between two rivalling students after at most $$$x$$$ swaps.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 100$$$, $$$0 \le x \le 100$$$, $$$1 \le a, b \le n$$$, $$$a \neq b$$$) — the number of students in the row, the number of swaps which you can do, and positions of first and second rivaling students respectively.OutputFor each test case print one integer — the maximum distance between two rivaling students which you can obtain     greedy      math      *800
