F2. Flying Sort (Hard Version)time 2  256 This is a hard version of the problem. In this version, the given array can contain equal elements and the constraints on $$$n$$$ are greater than in the easy version of the problem.You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers (the given array can contain equal elements). You can perform the following operations on array elements:  choose any index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$) and move the element $$$a[i]$$$ to the begin of the array;  choose any index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$) and move the element $$$a[i]$$$ to the end of the array. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, $$$a = [4, 7, 2, 2, 9]$$$, then the following sequence of operations can be performed:   after performing the operation of the first type to the second element, the array $$$a$$$ will become $$$[7, 4, 2, 2, 9]$$$;  after performing the operation of the second type to the second element, the array $$$a$$$ will become $$$[7, 2, 2, 9, 4]$$$. You can perform operations of any type any number of times in any order.Find the minimum total number of operations of the first and second type that will make the $$$a$$$ array sorted in non-decreasing order. In other words, what is the minimum number of operations must be performed so the array satisfies the inequalities $$$a[1] \le a[2] \le \ldots \le a[n]$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the test. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case starts with a line containing an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$.Then follow $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — an array that needs to be sorted by the given operations. The given array can contain equal elements.The sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases in one test does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case output one integer — the minimum total number of operations of the first and second type, which will make the array sorted in non-decreasing order     binary search      data structures      dp      greedy      sortings      two pointers      *2400
