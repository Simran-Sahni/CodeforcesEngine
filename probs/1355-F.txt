F. Guess Divisors Counttime 2  256 This is an interactive problem.We have hidden an integer $$$1 \le X \le 10^{9}$$$. You don't have to guess this number. You have to find the number of divisors of this number, and you don't even have to find the exact number: your answer will be considered correct if its absolute error is not greater than 7 or its relative error is not greater than $$$0.5$$$. More formally, let your answer be $$$ans$$$ and the number of divisors of $$$X$$$ be $$$d$$$, then your answer will be considered correct if at least one of the two following conditions is true: $$$| ans - d | \le 7$$$; $$$\frac{1}{2} \le \frac{ans}{d} \le 2$$$.You can make at most $$$22$$$ queries. One query consists of one integer $$$1 \le Q \le 10^{18}$$$. In response, you will get $$$gcd(X, Q)$$$ — the greatest common divisor of $$$X$$$ and $$$Q$$$.The number $$$X$$$ is fixed before all queries. In other words, interactor is not adaptive.Let's call the process of guessing the number of divisors of number $$$X$$$ a game. In one test you will have to play $$$T$$$ independent games, that is, guess the number of divisors $$$T$$$ times for $$$T$$$ independent values of $$$X$$$.InputThe first line of input contains one integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \le T \le 100$$$) — the number of games.InteractionTo make a query print a line "? Q" ($$$1 \le Q \le 10^{18}$$$). After that read one integer $$$gcd(X, Q)$$$. You can make no more than $$$22$$$ such queries during one game.If you are confident that you have figured out the number of divisors of $$$X$$$ with enough precision, you can print your answer in "! ans" format. $$$ans$$$ have to be an integer. If this was the last game, you have to terminate the program, otherwise you have to start the next game immediately. Note that the interactor doesn't print anything in response to you printing answer.After printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. To do this, use: fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; System.out.flush() in Java; flush(output) in Pascal; stdout.flush() in Python; see documentation for other languages.HacksTo hack, use the following format:The first line contains one integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \le T \le 100$$$) — the number of games.Each of the next $$$T$$$ lines contains one integer $$$X$$$ ($$$1 \le X \le 10^{9}$$$) — the hidden number.So the example has the form 2998244353419430     constructive algorithms      interactive      number theory      *2600
