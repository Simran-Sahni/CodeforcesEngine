D. Phoenix and Sciencetime 2  256 Phoenix has decided to become a scientist! He is currently investigating the growth of bacteria.Initially, on day $$$1$$$, there is one bacterium with mass $$$1$$$.Every day, some number of bacteria will split (possibly zero or all). When a bacterium of mass $$$m$$$ splits, it becomes two bacteria of mass $$$\frac{m}{2}$$$ each. For example, a bacterium of mass $$$3$$$ can split into two bacteria of mass $$$1.5$$$.Also, every night, the mass of every bacteria will increase by one.Phoenix is wondering if it is possible for the total mass of all the bacteria to be exactly $$$n$$$. If it is possible, he is interested in the way to obtain that mass using the minimum possible number of nights. Help him become the best scientist!InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^9$$$) — the sum of bacteria masses that Phoenix is interested in. OutputFor each test case, if there is no way for the bacteria to exactly achieve total mass $$$n$$$, print -1. Otherwise, print two lines.The first line should contain an integer $$$d$$$  — the minimum number of nights needed.The next line should contain $$$d$$$ integers, with the $$$i$$$-th integer representing the number of bacteria that should split on the $$$i$$$-th day.If there are multiple solutions, print any     binary search      constructive algorithms      greedy      implementation      math      *1900
