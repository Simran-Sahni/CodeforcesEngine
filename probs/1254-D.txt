D. Tree Queriestime 5  512 Hanh is a famous biologist. He loves growing trees and doing experiments on his own garden.One day, he got a tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. Vertices are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. A tree with $$$n$$$ vertices is an undirected connected graph with $$$n-1$$$ edges. Initially, Hanh sets the value of every vertex to $$$0$$$.Now, Hanh performs $$$q$$$ operations, each is either of the following types:   Type $$$1$$$: Hanh selects a vertex $$$v$$$ and an integer $$$d$$$. Then he chooses some vertex $$$r$$$ uniformly at random, lists all vertices $$$u$$$ such that the path from $$$r$$$ to $$$u$$$ passes through $$$v$$$. Hanh then increases the value of all such vertices $$$u$$$ by $$$d$$$.  Type $$$2$$$: Hanh selects a vertex $$$v$$$ and calculates the expected value of $$$v$$$. Since Hanh is good at biology but not math, he needs your help on these operations.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, q \leq 150\,000$$$) — the number of vertices on Hanh's tree and the number of operations he performs.Each of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \leq u, v \leq n$$$), denoting that there is an edge connecting two vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It is guaranteed that these $$$n - 1$$$ edges form a tree.Each of the last $$$q$$$ lines describes an operation in either formats:   $$$1$$$ $$$v$$$ $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \leq v \leq n, 0 \leq d \leq 10^7$$$), representing a first-type operation.  $$$2$$$ $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \leq v \leq n$$$), representing a second-type operation. It is guaranteed that there is at least one query of the second type.OutputFor each operation of the second type, write the expected value on a single line. Let $$$M = 998244353$$$, it can be shown that the expected value can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \not \equiv 0 \pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \le x < M$$$ and $$$x \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}$$$     data structures      probabilities      trees      *2700
