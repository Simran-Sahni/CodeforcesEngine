C. K Integerstime 3  256 You are given a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$.In one move you can swap two adjacent values.You want to perform a minimum number of moves, such that in the end there will exist a subsegment $$$1,2,\ldots, k$$$, in other words in the end there should be an integer $$$i$$$, $$$1 \leq i \leq n-k+1$$$ such that $$$p_i = 1, p_{i+1} = 2, \ldots, p_{i+k-1}=k$$$.Let $$$f(k)$$$ be the minimum number of moves that you need to make a subsegment with values $$$1,2,\ldots,k$$$ appear in the permutation.You need to find $$$f(1), f(2), \ldots, f(n)$$$.InputThe first line of input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 200\,000$$$): the number of elements in the permutation.The next line of input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$: given permutation ($$$1 \leq p_i \leq n$$$).OutputPrint $$$n$$$ integers, the minimum number of moves that you need to make a subsegment with values $$$1,2,\ldots,k$$$ appear in the permutation, for $$$k=1, 2, \ldots, n$$$.     binary search      data structures      *2300
