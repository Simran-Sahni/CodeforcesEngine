E. Tournamenttime 2  256 You are organizing a boxing tournament, where $$$n$$$ boxers will participate ($$$n$$$ is a power of $$$2$$$), and your friend is one of them. All boxers have different strength from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and boxer $$$i$$$ wins in the match against boxer $$$j$$$ if and only if $$$i$$$ is stronger than $$$j$$$.The tournament will be organized as follows: $$$n$$$ boxers will be divided into pairs; the loser in each pair leaves the tournament, and $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ winners advance to the next stage, where they are divided into pairs again, and the winners in all pairs advance to the next stage, and so on, until only one boxer remains (who is declared the winner).Your friend really wants to win the tournament, but he may be not the strongest boxer. To help your friend win the tournament, you may bribe his opponents: if your friend is fighting with a boxer you have bribed, your friend wins even if his strength is lower.Furthermore, during each stage you distribute the boxers into pairs as you wish.The boxer with strength $$$i$$$ can be bribed if you pay him $$$a_i$$$ dollars. What is the minimum number of dollars you have to spend to make your friend win the tournament, provided that you arrange the boxers into pairs during each stage as you wish?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2^{18}$$$) — the number of boxers. $$$n$$$ is a power of $$$2$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ is the number of dollars you have to pay if you want to bribe the boxer with strength $$$i$$$. Exactly one of $$$a_i$$$ is equal to $$$-1$$$ — it means that the boxer with strength $$$i$$$ is your friend. All other values are in the range $$$[1, 10^9]$$$.OutputPrint one integer — the minimum number of dollars you have to pay so your friend wins.     brute force      dp      greedy      *2400
