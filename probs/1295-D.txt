D. Same GCDstime 2  256 You are given two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$m$$$. Calculate the number of integers $$$x$$$ such that $$$0 \le x < m$$$ and $$$\gcd(a, m) = \gcd(a + x, m)$$$.Note: $$$\gcd(a, b)$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.InputThe first line contains the single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \le T \le 50$$$) — the number of test cases.Next $$$T$$$ lines contain test cases — one per line. Each line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le a < m \le 10^{10}$$$).OutputPrint $$$T$$$ integers — one per test case. For each test case print the number of appropriate $$$x$$$-s     math      number theory      *1800
