C. Cut and Pastetime 2  256 We start with a string $$$s$$$ consisting only of the digits $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, or $$$3$$$. The length of $$$s$$$ is denoted by $$$|s|$$$. For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$|s|$$$, the $$$i$$$-th character of $$$s$$$ is denoted by $$$s_i$$$. There is one cursor. The cursor's location $$$\ell$$$ is denoted by an integer in $$$\{0, \ldots, |s|\}$$$, with the following meaning:   If $$$\ell = 0$$$, then the cursor is located before the first character of $$$s$$$.  If $$$\ell = |s|$$$, then the cursor is located right after the last character of $$$s$$$.  If $$$0 < \ell < |s|$$$, then the cursor is located between $$$s_\ell$$$ and $$$s_{\ell+1}$$$. We denote by $$$s_\text{left}$$$ the string to the left of the cursor and $$$s_\text{right}$$$ the string to the right of the cursor. We also have a string $$$c$$$, which we call our clipboard, which starts out as empty. There are three types of actions:  The Move action. Move the cursor one step to the right. This increments $$$\ell$$$ once.  The Cut action. Set $$$c \leftarrow s_\text{right}$$$, then set $$$s \leftarrow s_\text{left}$$$.  The Paste action. Append the value of $$$c$$$ to the end of the string $$$s$$$. Note that this doesn't modify $$$c$$$. The cursor initially starts at $$$\ell = 0$$$. Then, we perform the following procedure:  Perform the Move action once.  Perform the Cut action once.  Perform the Paste action $$$s_\ell$$$ times.  If $$$\ell = x$$$, stop. Otherwise, return to step 1. You're given the initial string $$$s$$$ and the integer $$$x$$$. What is the length of $$$s$$$ when the procedure stops? Since this value may be very large, only find it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$\ell \le |s|$$$ at any time.InputThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) denoting the number of test cases. The next lines contain descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le x \le 10^6$$$). The second line of each test case consists of the initial string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le 500$$$). It is guaranteed, that $$$s$$$ consists of the characters "1", "2", "3".It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$x$$$ in a single file is at most $$$10^6$$$. It is guaranteed that in each test case before the procedure will stop it will be true that $$$\ell \le |s|$$$ at any time.OutputFor each test case, output a single line containing a single integer denoting the answer for that test case modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.     implementation      math      *1700
