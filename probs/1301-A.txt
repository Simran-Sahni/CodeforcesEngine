A. Three Stringstime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given three strings $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ of the same length $$$n$$$. The strings consist of lowercase English letters only. The $$$i$$$-th letter of $$$a$$$ is $$$a_i$$$, the $$$i$$$-th letter of $$$b$$$ is $$$b_i$$$, the $$$i$$$-th letter of $$$c$$$ is $$$c_i$$$.For every $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$) you must swap (i.e. exchange) $$$c_i$$$ with either $$$a_i$$$ or $$$b_i$$$. So in total you'll perform exactly $$$n$$$ swap operations, each of them either $$$c_i \leftrightarrow a_i$$$ or $$$c_i \leftrightarrow b_i$$$ ($$$i$$$ iterates over all integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, inclusive).For example, if $$$a$$$ is "code", $$$b$$$ is "true", and $$$c$$$ is "help", you can make $$$c$$$ equal to "crue" taking the $$$1$$$-st and the $$$4$$$-th letters from $$$a$$$ and the others from $$$b$$$. In this way $$$a$$$ becomes "hodp" and $$$b$$$ becomes "tele".Is it possible that after these swaps the string $$$a$$$ becomes exactly the same as the string $$$b$$$?InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters $$$b$$$.The third line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters $$$c$$$.It is guaranteed that in each test case these three strings are non-empty and have the same length, which is not exceeding $$$100$$$.OutputPrint $$$t$$$ lines with answers for all test cases. For each test case:If it is possible to make string $$$a$$$ equal to string $$$b$$$ print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).You can print either lowercase or uppercase letters in the answers     implementation      strings      *800
