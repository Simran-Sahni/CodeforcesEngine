C. Ternary XORtime 1 secondmemory 256 A number is ternary if it contains only digits $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$. For example, the following numbers are ternary: $$$1022$$$, $$$11$$$, $$$21$$$, $$$2002$$$.You are given a long ternary number $$$x$$$. The first (leftmost) digit of $$$x$$$ is guaranteed to be $$$2$$$, the other digits of $$$x$$$ can be $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$ or $$$2$$$.Let's define the ternary XOR operation $$$\odot$$$ of two ternary numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ (both of length $$$n$$$) as a number $$$c = a \odot b$$$ of length $$$n$$$, where $$$c_i = (a_i + b_i) \% 3$$$ (where $$$\%$$$ is modulo operation). In other words, add the corresponding digits and take the remainders of the sums when divided by $$$3$$$. For example, $$$10222 \odot 11021 = 21210$$$.Your task is to find such ternary numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ both of length $$$n$$$ and both without leading zeros that $$$a \odot b = x$$$ and $$$max(a, b)$$$ is the minimum possible.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the length of $$$x$$$. The second line of the test case contains ternary number $$$x$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ digits $$$0, 1$$$ or $$$2$$$. It is guaranteed that the first digit of $$$x$$$ is $$$2$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^4$$$ ($$$\sum n \le 5 \cdot 10^4$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer — two ternary integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ both of length $$$n$$$ and both without leading zeros such that $$$a \odot b = x$$$ and $$$max(a, b)$$$ is the minimum possible. If there are several answers, you can print any     greedy      implementation      *1200
