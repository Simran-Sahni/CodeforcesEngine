D1. Beautiful Bracket Sequence (easy version)time 2  256 This is the easy version of this problem. The only difference is the limit of $$$n$$$ - the length of the input string. In this version, $$$1 \leq n \leq 2000$$$. The hard version of this challenge is not offered in the round for the second division. Let's define a correct bracket sequence and its depth as follow:  An empty string is a correct bracket sequence with depth $$$0$$$.  If "s" is a correct bracket sequence with depth $$$d$$$ then "(s)" is a correct bracket sequence with depth $$$d + 1$$$.  If "s" and "t" are both correct bracket sequences then their concatenation "st" is a correct bracket sequence with depth equal to the maximum depth of $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$. For a (not necessarily correct) bracket sequence $$$s$$$, we define its depth as the maximum depth of any correct bracket sequence induced by removing some characters from $$$s$$$ (possibly zero). For example: the bracket sequence $$$s = $$$"())(())" has depth $$$2$$$, because by removing the third character we obtain a correct bracket sequence "()(())" with depth $$$2$$$.Given a string $$$a$$$ consists of only characters '(', ')' and '?'. Consider all (not necessarily correct) bracket sequences obtained by replacing all characters '?' in $$$a$$$ by either '(' or ')'. Calculate the sum of all the depths of all these bracket sequences. As this number can be large, find it modulo $$$998244353$$$.Hacks in this problem in the first division can be done only if easy and hard versions of this problem was solved.InputThe only line contains a non-empty string consist of only '(', ')' and '?'. The length of the string is at most $$$2000$$$.OutputPrint the answer modulo $$$998244353$$$ in a single line.     combinatorics      dp      probabilities      *2600
