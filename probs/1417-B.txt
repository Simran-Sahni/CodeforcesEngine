B. Two Arraystime 1 secondmemory 256 RedDreamer has an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers, and an unlucky integer $$$T$$$.Let's denote the misfortune of array $$$b$$$ having length $$$m$$$ as $$$f(b)$$$ — the number of pairs of integers $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$1 \le i < j \le m$$$ and $$$b_i + b_j = T$$$. RedDreamer has to paint each element of $$$a$$$ into one of two colors, white and black (for each element, the color is chosen independently), and then create two arrays $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$ so that all white elements belong to $$$c$$$, and all black elements belong to $$$d$$$ (it is possible that one of these two arrays becomes empty). RedDreamer wants to paint the elements in such a way that $$$f(c) + f(d)$$$ is minimum possible.For example:  if $$$n = 6$$$, $$$T = 7$$$ and $$$a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]$$$, it is possible to paint the $$$1$$$-st, the $$$4$$$-th and the $$$5$$$-th elements white, and all other elements black. So $$$c = [1, 4, 5]$$$, $$$d = [2, 3, 6]$$$, and $$$f(c) + f(d) = 0 + 0 = 0$$$;  if $$$n = 3$$$, $$$T = 6$$$ and $$$a = [3, 3, 3]$$$, it is possible to paint the $$$1$$$-st element white, and all other elements black. So $$$c = [3]$$$, $$$d = [3, 3]$$$, and $$$f(c) + f(d) = 0 + 1 = 1$$$. Help RedDreamer to paint the array optimally!InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$, $$$0 \le T \le 10^9$$$) — the number of elements in the array and the unlucky integer, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print $$$n$$$ integers: $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$, ..., $$$p_n$$$ (each $$$p_i$$$ is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$) denoting the colors. If $$$p_i$$$ is $$$0$$$, then $$$a_i$$$ is white and belongs to the array $$$c$$$, otherwise it is black and belongs to the array $$$d$$$.If there are multiple answers that minimize the value of $$$f(c) + f(d)$$$, print any of them     greedy      math      sortings      *1100
