B. Blockstime 2  256 There are $$$n$$$ blocks arranged in a row and numbered from left to right, starting from one. Each block is either black or white. You may perform the following operation zero or more times: choose two adjacent blocks and invert their colors (white block becomes black, and vice versa). You want to find a sequence of operations, such that they make all the blocks having the same color. You don't have to minimize the number of operations, but it should not exceed $$$3 \cdot n$$$. If it is impossible to find such a sequence of operations, you need to report it.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 200$$$) — the number of blocks.The second line contains one string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ characters, each character is either "W" or "B". If the $$$i$$$-th character is "W", then the $$$i$$$-th block is white. If the $$$i$$$-th character is "B", then the $$$i$$$-th block is black. OutputIf it is impossible to make all the blocks having the same color, print $$$-1$$$.Otherwise, print an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \le k \le 3 \cdot n$$$) — the number of operations. Then print $$$k$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k$$$ $$$(1 \le p_j \le n - 1)$$$, where $$$p_j$$$ is the position of the left block in the pair of blocks that should be affected by the $$$j$$$-th operation.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.     greedy      math      *1300
