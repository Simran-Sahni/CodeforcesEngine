A. Beautiful Stringtime 1 secondmemory 256 A string is called beautiful if no two consecutive characters are equal. For example, "ababcb", "a" and "abab" are beautiful strings, while "aaaaaa", "abaa" and "bb" are not.Ahcl wants to construct a beautiful string. He has a string $$$s$$$, consisting of only characters 'a', 'b', 'c' and '?'. Ahcl needs to replace each character '?' with one of the three characters 'a', 'b' or 'c', such that the resulting string is beautiful. Please help him!More formally, after replacing all characters '?', the condition $$$s_i \neq s_{i+1}$$$ should be satisfied for all $$$1 \leq i \leq |s| - 1$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$.InputThe first line contains positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Next $$$t$$$ lines contain the descriptions of test cases.Each line contains a non-empty string $$$s$$$ consisting of only characters 'a', 'b', 'c' and '?'. It is guaranteed that in each test case a string $$$s$$$ has at least one character '?'. The sum of lengths of strings $$$s$$$ in all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case given in the input print the answer in the following format:  If it is impossible to create a beautiful string, print "-1" (without quotes);  Otherwise, print the resulting beautiful string after replacing all '?' characters. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.     constructive algorithms      greedy      *1000
