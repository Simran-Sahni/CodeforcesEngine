B. Beautiful Sequencetime 1 secondmemory 256 An integer sequence is called beautiful if the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to $$$1$$$. More formally, a sequence $$$s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_{n}$$$ is beautiful if $$$|s_i - s_{i+1}| = 1$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq n - 1$$$.Trans has $$$a$$$ numbers $$$0$$$, $$$b$$$ numbers $$$1$$$, $$$c$$$ numbers $$$2$$$ and $$$d$$$ numbers $$$3$$$. He wants to construct a beautiful sequence using all of these $$$a + b + c + d$$$ numbers.However, it turns out to be a non-trivial task, and Trans was not able to do it. Could you please help Trans?InputThe only input line contains four non-negative integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$ ($$$0 < a+b+c+d \leq 10^5$$$).OutputIf it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence satisfying the above constraints, print "NO" (without quotes) in one line.Otherwise, print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. Then in the second line print $$$a + b + c + d$$$ integers, separated by spaces — a beautiful sequence. There should be $$$a$$$ numbers equal to $$$0$$$, $$$b$$$ numbers equal to $$$1$$$, $$$c$$$ numbers equal to $$$2$$$ and $$$d$$$ numbers equal to $$$3$$$.If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.     brute force      constructive algorithms      greedy      *1900
