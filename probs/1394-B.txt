B. Boboniu Walks on Graphtime 1 secondmemory 256 Boboniu has a directed graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges.The out-degree of each vertex is at most $$$k$$$.Each edge has an integer weight between $$$1$$$ and $$$m$$$. No two edges have equal weights.Boboniu likes to walk on the graph with some specific rules, which is represented by a tuple $$$(c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_k)$$$. If he now stands on a vertex $$$u$$$ with out-degree $$$i$$$, then he will go to the next vertex by the edge with the $$$c_i$$$-th $$$(1\le c_i\le i)$$$ smallest weight among all edges outgoing from $$$u$$$.Now Boboniu asks you to calculate the number of tuples $$$(c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_k)$$$ such that  $$$1\le c_i\le i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ ($$$1\le i\le k$$$).  Starting from any vertex $$$u$$$, it is possible to go back to $$$u$$$ in finite time by walking on the graph under the described rules. InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$2\le m\le \min(2\cdot 10^5,n(n-1) )$$$, $$$1\le k\le 9$$$).Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$ and $$$w$$$ $$$(1\le u,v\le n,u\ne v,1\le w\le m)$$$, denoting an edge from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ with weight $$$w$$$. It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple edges and each vertex has at least one edge starting from itself.It is guaranteed that the out-degree of each vertex is at most $$$k$$$ and no two edges have equal weight.OutputPrint one integer: the number of tuples.     brute force      dfs and similar      graphs      hashing      *2300
