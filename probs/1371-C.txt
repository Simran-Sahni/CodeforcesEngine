Now she has $$$a$$$ vanilla cookies and $$$b$$$ chocolate cookies for the party.She invited $$$n$$$ guests of the first type and $$$m$$$ guests of the second type to the party. They will come to the party in some order. After coming to the party, each guest will choose the type of cookie (vanilla or chocolate) to eat. There is a difference in the way how they choose that type:If there are $$$v$$$ vanilla cookies and $$$c$$$ chocolate cookies at the moment, when the guest comes, then  if the guest of the first type: if $$$v>c$$$ the guest selects a vanilla cookie. Otherwise, the guest selects a chocolate cookie.  if the guest of the second type: if $$$v>c$$$ the guest selects a chocolate cookie. Otherwise, the guest selects a vanilla cookie. After that:  If there is at least one cookie of the selected type, the guest eats one.  Otherwise (there are no cookies of the selected type), the guest gets angry and returns to home. Anna wants to know if there exists some order of guests, such that no one guest gets angry. Your task is to answer her question.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Next $$$t$$$ lines contain descriptions of test cases.For each test case, the only line contains four integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \le a,b,n,m \le 10^{18}, n+m \neq 0$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer in one line. If there exists at least one valid order, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower)     greedy      implementation      math      *1300
