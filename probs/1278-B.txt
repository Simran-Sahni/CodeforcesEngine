B. A and Btime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. You can perform a sequence of operations: during the first operation you choose one of these numbers and increase it by $$$1$$$; during the second operation you choose one of these numbers and increase it by $$$2$$$, and so on. You choose the number of these operations yourself.For example, if $$$a = 1$$$ and $$$b = 3$$$, you can perform the following sequence of three operations:   add $$$1$$$ to $$$a$$$, then $$$a = 2$$$ and $$$b = 3$$$;  add $$$2$$$ to $$$b$$$, then $$$a = 2$$$ and $$$b = 5$$$;  add $$$3$$$ to $$$a$$$, then $$$a = 5$$$ and $$$b = 5$$$. Calculate the minimum number of operations required to make $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ equal. InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b \le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case print one integer — the minimum numbers of operations required to make $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ equal.     greedy      math      *1500
