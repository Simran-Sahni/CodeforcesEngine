F. Almost Same Distancetime 5  256 Let $$$G$$$ be a simple graph. Let $$$W$$$ be a non-empty subset of vertices. Then $$$W$$$ is almost-$$$k$$$-uniform if for each pair of distinct vertices $$$u,v \in W$$$ the distance between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ is either $$$k$$$ or $$$k+1$$$.You are given a tree on $$$n$$$ vertices. For each $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, find the maximum size of an almost-$$$i$$$-uniform set.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) – the number of vertices of the tree.Then $$$n-1$$$ lines follows, the $$$i$$$-th of which consisting of two space separated integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq n$$$) meaning that there is an edge between vertices $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$. It is guaranteed that the given graph is tree. OutputOutput a single line containing $$$n$$$ space separated integers $$$a_i$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ is the maximum size of an almost-$$$i$$$-uniform set.     dfs and similar      graphs      *2900
