D. Yet Another Yet Another Tasktime 1.5  512 Alice and Bob are playing yet another card game. This time the rules are the following. There are $$$n$$$ cards lying in a row in front of them. The $$$i$$$-th card has value $$$a_i$$$. First, Alice chooses a non-empty consecutive segment of cards $$$[l; r]$$$ ($$$l \le r$$$). After that Bob removes a single card $$$j$$$ from that segment $$$(l \le j \le r)$$$. The score of the game is the total value of the remaining cards on the segment $$$(a_l + a_{l + 1} + \dots + a_{j - 1} + a_{j + 1} + \dots + a_{r - 1} + a_r)$$$. In particular, if Alice chooses a segment with just one element, then the score after Bob removes the only card is $$$0$$$.Alice wants to make the score as big as possible. Bob takes such a card that the score is as small as possible.What segment should Alice choose so that the score is maximum possible? Output the maximum score.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the number of cards.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-30 \le a_i \le 30$$$) — the values on the cards.OutputPrint a single integer — the final score of the game.     data structures      dp      implementation      two pointers      *2000
