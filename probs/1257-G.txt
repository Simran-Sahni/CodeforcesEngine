G. Divisor Settime 5  512 You are given an integer $$$x$$$ represented as a product of $$$n$$$ its prime divisors $$$p_1 \cdot p_2, \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n$$$. Let $$$S$$$ be the set of all positive integer divisors of $$$x$$$ (including $$$1$$$ and $$$x$$$ itself).We call a set of integers $$$D$$$ good if (and only if) there is no pair $$$a \in D$$$, $$$b \in D$$$ such that $$$a \ne b$$$ and $$$a$$$ divides $$$b$$$.Find a good subset of $$$S$$$ with maximum possible size. Since the answer can be large, print the size of the subset modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe first line contains the single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of prime divisors in representation of $$$x$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$$$ ($$$2 \le p_i \le 3 \cdot 10^6$$$) — the prime factorization of $$$x$$$.OutputPrint the maximum possible size of a good subset modulo $$$998244353$$$.     divide and conquer      fft      greedy      math      number theory      *2600
