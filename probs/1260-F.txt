F. Colored Treetime 2.5  256 You're given a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices. The color of the $$$i$$$-th vertex is $$$h_{i}$$$.The value of the tree is defined as $$$\sum\limits_{h_{i} = h_{j}, 1 \le i < j \le n}{dis(i,j)}$$$, where $$$dis(i,j)$$$ is the number of edges on the shortest path between $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$. The color of each vertex is lost, you only remember that $$$h_{i}$$$ can be any integer from $$$[l_{i}, r_{i}]$$$(inclusive). You want to calculate the sum of values of all trees meeting these conditions modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$ (the set of edges is fixed, but each color is unknown, so there are $$$\prod\limits_{i = 1}^{n} (r_{i} - l_{i} + 1)$$$ different trees).InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices.Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, each line contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le 10^5$$$) denoting the range of possible colors of vertex $$$i$$$.Then $$$n - 1$$$ lines follow, each containing two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le u, v \le n$$$, $$$u \ne v$$$) denoting an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.OutputPrint one integer — the sum of values of all possible trees, taken modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$     data structures      trees      *2700
