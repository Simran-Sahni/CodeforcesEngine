D. Constructing the Arraytime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of zeros. You perform $$$n$$$ actions with this array: during the $$$i$$$-th action, the following sequence of operations appears:  Choose the maximum by length subarray (continuous subsegment) consisting only of zeros, among all such segments choose the leftmost one;  Let this segment be $$$[l; r]$$$. If $$$r-l+1$$$ is odd (not divisible by $$$2$$$) then assign (set) $$$a[\frac{l+r}{2}] := i$$$ (where $$$i$$$ is the number of the current action), otherwise (if $$$r-l+1$$$ is even) assign (set) $$$a[\frac{l+r-1}{2}] := i$$$. Consider the array $$$a$$$ of length $$$5$$$ (initially $$$a=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$). Then it changes as follows:  Firstly, we choose the segment $$$[1; 5]$$$ and assign $$$a[3] := 1$$$, so $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]$$$;  then we choose the segment $$$[1; 2]$$$ and assign $$$a[1] := 2$$$, so $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[2, 0, 1, 0, 0]$$$;  then we choose the segment $$$[4; 5]$$$ and assign $$$a[4] := 3$$$, so $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[2, 0, 1, 3, 0]$$$;  then we choose the segment $$$[2; 2]$$$ and assign $$$a[2] := 4$$$, so $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[2, 4, 1, 3, 0]$$$;  and at last we choose the segment $$$[5; 5]$$$ and assign $$$a[5] := 5$$$, so $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[2, 4, 1, 3, 5]$$$. Your task is to find the array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ after performing all $$$n$$$ actions. Note that the answer exists and unique.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The only line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer — the array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ after performing $$$n$$$ actions described in the problem statement.
