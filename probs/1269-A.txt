A. Equationtime 3  256 Let's call a positive integer composite if it has at least one divisor other than $$$1$$$ and itself. For example:  the following numbers are composite: $$$1024$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$6$$$, $$$9$$$;  the following numbers are not composite: $$$13$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$37$$$. You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$. Find two composite integers $$$a,b$$$ such that $$$a-b=n$$$.It can be proven that solution always exists.InputThe input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^7$$$): the given integer.OutputPrint two composite integers $$$a,b$$$ ($$$2 \leq a, b \leq 10^9, a-b=n$$$).It can be proven, that solution always exists.If there are several possible solutions, you can print any.      brute force      math      *800
