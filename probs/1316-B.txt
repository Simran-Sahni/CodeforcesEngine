B. String Modificationtime 1 secondmemory 256 Vasya has a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. He decides to make the following modification to the string:   Pick an integer $$$k$$$, ($$$1 \leq k \leq n$$$).  For $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-k+1$$$, reverse the substring $$$s[i:i+k-1]$$$ of $$$s$$$. For example, if string $$$s$$$ is qwer and $$$k = 2$$$, below is the series of transformations the string goes through:   qwer (original string)  wqer (after reversing the first substring of length $$$2$$$)  weqr (after reversing the second substring of length $$$2$$$)  werq (after reversing the last substring of length $$$2$$$)  Hence, the resulting string after modifying $$$s$$$ with $$$k = 2$$$ is werq. Vasya wants to choose a $$$k$$$ such that the string obtained after the above-mentioned modification is lexicographically smallest possible among all choices of $$$k$$$. Among all such $$$k$$$, he wants to choose the smallest one. Since he is busy attending Felicity 2020, he asks for your help.A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds:   $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \ne b$$$;  in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$. InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5000$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$.The second line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ lowercase latin letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.OutputFor each testcase output two lines:In the first line output the lexicographically smallest string $$$s'$$$ achievable after the above-mentioned modification. In the second line output the appropriate value of $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq k \leq n$$$) that you chose for performing the modification. If there are multiple values of $$$k$$$ that give the lexicographically smallest string, output the smallest value of $$$k$$$ among them     brute force      constructive algorithms      implementation      sortings      strings      *1400
