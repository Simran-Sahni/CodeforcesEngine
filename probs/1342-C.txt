C. Yet Another Counting Problemtime 3.5  256 You are given two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, and $$$q$$$ queries. The $$$i$$$-th query consists of two numbers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$, and the answer to it is the number of integers $$$x$$$ such that $$$l_i \le x \le r_i$$$, and $$$((x \bmod a) \bmod b) \ne ((x \bmod b) \bmod a)$$$. Calculate the answer for each query.Recall that $$$y \bmod z$$$ is the remainder of the division of $$$y$$$ by $$$z$$$. For example, $$$5 \bmod 3 = 2$$$, $$$7 \bmod 8 = 7$$$, $$$9 \bmod 4 = 1$$$, $$$9 \bmod 9 = 0$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b \le 200$$$; $$$1 \le q \le 500$$$).Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, each containing two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le 10^{18}$$$) for the corresponding query.OutputFor each test case, print $$$q$$$ integers — the answers to the queries of this test case in the order they appear     math      number theory      *1600
