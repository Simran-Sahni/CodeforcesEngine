A. Road To Zerotime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. You can perform two types of operations:   Pay $$$a$$$ dollars and increase or decrease any of these integers by $$$1$$$. For example, if $$$x = 0$$$ and $$$y = 7$$$ there are four possible outcomes after this operation:   $$$x = 0$$$, $$$y = 6$$$;  $$$x = 0$$$, $$$y = 8$$$;  $$$x = -1$$$, $$$y = 7$$$;  $$$x = 1$$$, $$$y = 7$$$.   Pay $$$b$$$ dollars and increase or decrease both integers by $$$1$$$. For example, if $$$x = 0$$$ and $$$y = 7$$$ there are two possible outcomes after this operation:   $$$x = -1$$$, $$$y = 6$$$;  $$$x = 1$$$, $$$y = 8$$$.  Your goal is to make both given integers equal zero simultaneously, i.e. $$$x = y = 0$$$. There are no other requirements. In particular, it is possible to move from $$$x=1$$$, $$$y=0$$$ to $$$x=y=0$$$.Calculate the minimum amount of dollars you have to spend on it.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$0 \le x, y \le 10^9$$$).The second line of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b \le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case print one integer — the minimum amount of dollars you have to spend     greedy      math      *1000
