A. Required Remaindertime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given three integers $$$x, y$$$ and $$$n$$$. Your task is to find the maximum integer $$$k$$$ such that $$$0 \le k \le n$$$ that $$$k \bmod x = y$$$, where $$$\bmod$$$ is modulo operation. Many programming languages use percent operator % to implement it.In other words, with given $$$x, y$$$ and $$$n$$$ you need to find the maximum possible integer from $$$0$$$ to $$$n$$$ that has the remainder $$$y$$$ modulo $$$x$$$.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases. It is guaranteed that such $$$k$$$ exists for each test case.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The next $$$t$$$ lines contain test cases.The only line of the test case contains three integers $$$x, y$$$ and $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le x \le 10^9;~ 0 \le y < x;~ y \le n \le 10^9$$$).It can be shown that such $$$k$$$ always exists under the given constraints.OutputFor each test case, print the answer — maximum non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that $$$0 \le k \le n$$$ and $$$k \bmod x = y$$$. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists     math      *800
