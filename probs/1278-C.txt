C. Berry Jamtime 2  256 Karlsson has recently discovered a huge stock of berry jam jars in the basement of the house. More specifically, there were $$$2n$$$ jars of strawberry and blueberry jam.All the $$$2n$$$ jars are arranged in a row. The stairs to the basement are exactly in the middle of that row. So when Karlsson enters the basement, he sees exactly $$$n$$$ jars to his left and $$$n$$$ jars to his right.For example, the basement might look like this:  Being the starightforward man he is, he immediately starts eating the jam. In one minute he chooses to empty either the first non-empty jar to his left or the first non-empty jar to his right.Finally, Karlsson decided that at the end the amount of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars should become the same.For example, this might be the result:  He has eaten $$$1$$$ jar to his left and then $$$5$$$ jars to his right. There remained exactly $$$3$$$ full jars of both strawberry and blueberry jam. Jars are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$2n$$$ from left to right, so Karlsson initially stands between jars $$$n$$$ and $$$n+1$$$.What is the minimum number of jars Karlsson is required to empty so that an equal number of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars is left?Your program should answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$2n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{2n}$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 2$$$) — $$$a_i=1$$$ means that the $$$i$$$-th jar from the left is a strawberry jam jar and $$$a_i=2$$$ means that it is a blueberry jam jar.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print the answer to it — the minimum number of jars Karlsson is required to empty so that an equal number of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars is left     data structures      dp      greedy      implementation      *1700
