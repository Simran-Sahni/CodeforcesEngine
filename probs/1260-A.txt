A. Heatingtime 1 secondmemory 256 Several days ago you bought a new house and now you are planning to start a renovation. Since winters in your region can be very cold you need to decide how to heat rooms in your house.Your house has $$$n$$$ rooms. In the $$$i$$$-th room you can install at most $$$c_i$$$ heating radiators. Each radiator can have several sections, but the cost of the radiator with $$$k$$$ sections is equal to $$$k^2$$$ burles.Since rooms can have different sizes, you calculated that you need at least $$$sum_i$$$ sections in total in the $$$i$$$-th room. For each room calculate the minimum cost to install at most $$$c_i$$$ radiators with total number of sections not less than $$$sum_i$$$.InputThe first line contains single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 1000$$$) — the number of rooms.Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains the description of some room. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$c_i$$$ and $$$sum_i$$$ ($$$1 \le c_i, sum_i \le 10^4$$$) — the maximum number of radiators and the minimum total number of sections in the $$$i$$$-th room, respectively.OutputFor each room print one integer — the minimum possible cost to install at most $$$c_i$$$ radiators with total number of sections not less than $$$sum_i$$$     math      *1000
