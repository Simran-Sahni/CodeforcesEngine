D. Anti-Sudokutime 2  256 You are given a correct solution of the sudoku puzzle. If you don't know what is the sudoku, you can read about it here.The picture showing the correct sudoku solution:Blocks are bordered with bold black color.Your task is to change at most $$$9$$$ elements of this field (i.e. choose some $$$1 \le i, j \le 9$$$ and change the number at the position $$$(i, j)$$$ to any other number in range $$$[1; 9]$$$) to make it anti-sudoku. The anti-sudoku is the $$$9 \times 9$$$ field, in which:  Any number in this field is in range $$$[1; 9]$$$;  each row contains at least two equal elements;  each column contains at least two equal elements;  each $$$3 \times 3$$$ block (you can read what is the block in the link above) contains at least two equal elements. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case consists of $$$9$$$ lines, each line consists of $$$9$$$ characters from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ without any whitespaces — the correct solution of the sudoku puzzle.OutputFor each test case, print the answer — the initial field with at most $$$9$$$ changed elements so that the obtained field is anti-sudoku. If there are several solutions, you can print any. It is guaranteed that the answer exists     constructive algorithms      implementation      *1300
