A6. Distinguish four Pauli gatestime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given an operation that implements a single-qubit unitary transformation: either the identity (I gate) or one of the Pauli gates (X, Y or Z gate). The operation will have Adjoint and Controlled variants defined.Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which unitary it was and to return  0 if it was the I gate,  1 if it was the X gate,  2 if it was the Y gate,  3 if it was the Z gate. You are allowed to apply the given operation and its adjoint/controlled variants exactly once.You have to implement an operation which takes a single-qubit operation as an input and returns an integer. Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;    operation Solve (unitary : (Qubit => Unit is Adj+Ctl)) : Int {        // your code here    }
