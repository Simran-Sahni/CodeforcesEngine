B. Yet Another Meme Problemtime 1 secondmemory 256 Try guessing the statement from this picture http://tiny.cc/ogyoiz.You are given two integers $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$, calculate the number of pairs $$$(a, b)$$$ such that $$$1 \le a \le A$$$, $$$1 \le b \le B$$$, and the equation $$$a \cdot b + a + b = conc(a, b)$$$ is true; $$$conc(a, b)$$$ is the concatenation of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ (for example, $$$conc(12, 23) = 1223$$$, $$$conc(100, 11) = 10011$$$). $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ should not contain leading zeroes.InputThe first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case contains two integers $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ $$$(1 \le A, B \le 10^9)$$$.OutputPrint one integer — the number of pairs $$$(a, b)$$$ such that $$$1 \le a \le A$$$, $$$1 \le b \le B$$$, and the equation $$$a \cdot b + a + b = conc(a, b)$$$ is true     math      *1100
