D. Boboniu and Jianghutime 1 secondmemory 256 Since Boboniu finished building his Jianghu, he has been doing Kungfu on these mountains every day. Boboniu designs a map for his $$$n$$$ mountains. He uses $$$n-1$$$ roads to connect all $$$n$$$ mountains. Every pair of mountains is connected via roads.For the $$$i$$$-th mountain, Boboniu estimated the tiredness of doing Kungfu on the top of it as $$$t_i$$$. He also estimated the height of each mountain as $$$h_i$$$.A path is a sequence of mountains $$$M$$$ such that for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i < |M|$$$), there exists a road between $$$M_i$$$ and $$$M_{i+1}$$$. Boboniu would regard the path as a challenge if for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1\le i<|M|$$$), $$$h_{M_i}\le h_{M_{i+1}}$$$.Boboniu wants to divide all $$$n-1$$$ roads into several challenges. Note that each road must appear in exactly one challenge, but a mountain may appear in several challenges. Boboniu wants to minimize the total tiredness to do all the challenges. The tiredness of a challenge $$$M$$$ is the sum of tiredness of all mountains in it, i.e. $$$\sum_{i=1}^{|M|}t_{M_i}$$$. He asked you to find the minimum total tiredness. As a reward for your work, you'll become a guardian in his Jianghu.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$), denoting the number of the mountains.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n$$$ ($$$1 \le t_i \le 10^6$$$), denoting the tiredness for Boboniu to do Kungfu on each mountain.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_n$$$ ($$$1 \le h_i \le 10^6$$$), denoting the height of each mountain.Each of the following $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \le u_i, v_i \le n, u_i \neq v_i$$$), denoting the ends of the road. It's guaranteed that all mountains are connected via roads.OutputPrint one integer: the smallest sum of tiredness of all challenges.     dp      greedy      sortings      trees      *2800
