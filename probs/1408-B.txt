B. Arrays Sumtime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given a non-decreasing array of non-negative integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. Also you are given a positive integer $$$k$$$.You want to find $$$m$$$ non-decreasing arrays of non-negative integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$, such that:  The size of $$$b_i$$$ is equal to $$$n$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq m$$$.  For all $$$1 \leq j \leq n$$$, $$$a_j = b_{1, j} + b_{2, j} + \ldots + b_{m, j}$$$. In the other word, array $$$a$$$ is the sum of arrays $$$b_i$$$.  The number of different elements in the array $$$b_i$$$ is at most $$$k$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq m$$$. Find the minimum possible value of $$$m$$$, or report that there is no possible $$$m$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$): the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 100$$$, $$$1 \leq k \leq n$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_n \leq 100$$$, $$$a_n > 0$$$).OutputFor each test case print a single integer: the minimum possible value of $$$m$$$. If there is no such $$$m$$$, print $$$-1$$$     constructive algorithms      greedy      math      *1400
