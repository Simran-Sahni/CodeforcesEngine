Otherwise:The first line should contain one integer, $$$n$$$, representing the length of the desired array. The next line should contain $$$n$$$ positive integers, the array itself. If there are multiple possible answers, print any.     bitmasks      constructive algorithms      greedy      number theory      *1700
