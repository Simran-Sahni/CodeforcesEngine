A5. Distinguish Z from -Ztime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given an operation that implements a single-qubit unitary transformation: either the Z gate or the -Z gate (i.e., the $$$-|0\rangle\langle0| + |1\rangle\langle1|$$$ gate: $$$(-Z)(\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle) = -\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$$$). The operation will have Adjoint and Controlled variants defined.Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which unitary it was and to return 0 if it was the Z gate or 1 if it was the -Z gate. You are allowed to apply the given operation and its adjoint/controlled variants exactly once.You have to implement an operation which takes a single-qubit operation as an input and returns an integer. Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;    operation Solve (unitary : (Qubit => Unit is Adj+Ctl)) : Int {        // your code here    }     *special problem
