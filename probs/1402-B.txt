B. Roadstime 1.5  256 The government of Treeland wants to build a new road network. There are $$$2N$$$ cities in Treeland. The unfinished plan of the road network already contains $$$N$$$ road segments, each of which connects two cities with a straight line. No two road segments have a common point (including their endpoints).  Your task is to determine $$$N-1$$$ additional road segments satisfying the following conditions:   Every new road segment must connect two cities with a straight line.  If two segments (new or old) have a common point, then this point must be an endpoint of both segments.  The road network connects all cities: for each pair of cities there is a path consisting of segments that connects the two cities. InputThe first line of the standard input contains $$$N$$$ ($$${2 \leq N \leq 10^5}$$$) â€“ the number of existing road segments. Each of the following $$$N$$$ lines contains four integers: $$$x_1,y_1, x_2, y_2$$$, where $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ are the coordinates of the endpoints of the segment $$$(-10^7 \leq x_i,y_i\leq 10^7)$$$.OutputThe standard output must contain $$$N-1$$$ lines, each of them containing four integers, $$$x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$$$, where $$$(x_1,y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ are the coordinates of the cities that are the endpoints of a new road segment. If there are multiple solutions, your program may output any of them.Scoring $$$ \begin{array}{|c|c|l|} \hline \text{Subtask} & \text{Points} & \text{Constraints} \\ \hline 1 & 0 & \text{samples}\\ \hline 2 & 15 & \text{all input segments are vertical.} \\ \hline 3 & 15 & \text{each pair of input segments are parallel.} \\ \hline 4 & 15 & \text{each input segment is either horizontal or vertical.} \\ \hline 5 & 15 & N \le 10\,000 \\ \hline 6 & 40 & \text{no additional constraints}\\ \hline \end{array} $$$     *special problem      geometry      sortings      *2900
