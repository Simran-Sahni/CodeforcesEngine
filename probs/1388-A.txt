A. Captain Flint and Crew Recruitmenttime 1 secondmemory 256 Despite his bad reputation, Captain Flint is a friendly person (at least, friendly to animals). Now Captain Flint is searching worthy sailors to join his new crew (solely for peaceful purposes). A sailor is considered as worthy if he can solve Flint's task.Recently, out of blue Captain Flint has been interested in math and even defined a new class of integers. Let's define a positive integer $$$x$$$ as nearly prime if it can be represented as $$$p \cdot q$$$, where $$$1 < p < q$$$ and $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are prime numbers. For example, integers $$$6$$$ and $$$10$$$ are nearly primes (since $$$2 \cdot 3 = 6$$$ and $$$2 \cdot 5 = 10$$$), but integers $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$16$$$, $$$17$$$ or $$$44$$$ are not.Captain Flint guessed an integer $$$n$$$ and asked you: can you represent it as the sum of $$$4$$$ different positive integers where at least $$$3$$$ of them should be nearly prime.Uncle Bogdan easily solved the task and joined the crew. Can you do the same?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.Next $$$t$$$ lines contain test cases — one per line. The first and only line of each test case contains the single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$$$ — the number Flint guessed.OutputFor each test case print:   YES and $$$4$$$ different positive integers such that at least $$$3$$$ of them are nearly prime and their sum is equal to $$$n$$$ (if there are multiple answers print any of them);  NO if there is no way to represent $$$n$$$ as the sum of $$$4$$$ different positive integers where at least $$$3$$$ of them are nearly prime.  You can print each character of YES or NO in any case     brute force      greedy      math      number theory      *800
