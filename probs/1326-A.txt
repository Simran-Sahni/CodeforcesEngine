A. Bad Ugly Numberstime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given a integer $$$n$$$ ($$$n > 0$$$). Find any integer $$$s$$$ which satisfies these conditions, or report that there are no such numbers:In the decimal representation of $$$s$$$:   $$$s > 0$$$,  $$$s$$$ consists of $$$n$$$ digits,  no digit in $$$s$$$ equals $$$0$$$,  $$$s$$$ is not divisible by any of it's digits. InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 400$$$), the number of test cases. The next $$$t$$$ lines each describe a test case.Each test case contains one positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print an integer $$$s$$$ which satisfies the conditions described above, or "-1" (without quotes), if no such number exists. If there are multiple possible solutions for $$$s$$$, print any solution     constructive algorithms      number theory      *1000
