A. Nash equilibriumtime 2  256 This is an unusual problem in an unusual contest, here is the announcement: http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/73543You are given a table $$$A$$$ of integers $$$n \times m$$$. The cell $$$(x, y)$$$ is called Nash equilibrium if both of the following conditions hold:   for each $$$x_1 \neq x$$$ $$$A_{xy} > A_{x_1y}$$$;  for each $$$y_1 \neq y$$$ $$$A_{xy} < A_{xy_1}$$$. Find a Nash equilibrium in $$$A$$$. If there exist several equilibria, print the one with minimum $$$x$$$. If still there are several possible answers, print the one with minimum $$$y$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$2 \leq n, m \leq 1000$$$), denoting the size of the table.Each of next $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$m$$$ space-separated integers $$$A_{ij}$$$ ($$$1 \leq A_{ij} \leq 10^9$$$).OutputOutput $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ â€” the coordinates of the lexicographically minimum Nash equilibrium in the table. In case there is no answer, print two zeroes instead.
