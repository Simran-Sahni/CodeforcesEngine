G. Subset with Zero Sumtime 2  256 You are given $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$, such that for each $$$1\le i \le n$$$ holds $$$i-n\le a_i\le i-1$$$.Find some nonempty subset of these integers, whose sum is equal to $$$0$$$. It can be shown that such a subset exists under given constraints. If there are several possible subsets with zero-sum, you can find any of them.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^6$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n \le 10^6$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$i-n \le a_i \le i-1$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output two lines.In the first line, output $$$s$$$ ($$$1\le s \le n$$$) — the number of elements in your subset.In the second line, output $$$s$$$ integers $$$i_1, i_2, \dots, i_s$$$ ($$$1\le i_k \le n$$$). All integers have to be pairwise different, and $$$a_{i_1} + a_{i_2} + \dots + a_{i_s}$$$ has to be equal to $$$0$$$. If there are several possible subsets with zero-sum, you can find any of them     constructive algorithms      dfs and similar      graphs      math      *2700
