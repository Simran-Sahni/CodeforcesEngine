C. Instant Noodlestime 2  512 Wu got hungry after an intense training session, and came to a nearby store to buy his favourite instant noodles. After Wu paid for his purchase, the cashier gave him an interesting task.You are given a bipartite graph with positive integers in all vertices of the right half. For a subset $$$S$$$ of vertices of the left half we define $$$N(S)$$$ as the set of all vertices of the right half adjacent to at least one vertex in $$$S$$$, and $$$f(S)$$$ as the sum of all numbers in vertices of $$$N(S)$$$. Find the greatest common divisor of $$$f(S)$$$ for all possible non-empty subsets $$$S$$$ (assume that GCD of empty set is $$$0$$$).Wu is too tired after his training to solve this problem. Help him!InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 500\,000$$$) — the number of test cases in the given test set. Test case descriptions follow.The first line of each case description contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1~\leq~n,~m~\leq~500\,000$$$) — the number of vertices in either half of the graph, and the number of edges respectively.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq c_i \leq 10^{12}$$$). The $$$i$$$-th number describes the integer in the vertex $$$i$$$ of the right half of the graph.Each of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains a pair of integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq n$$$), describing an edge between the vertex $$$u_i$$$ of the left half and the vertex $$$v_i$$$ of the right half. It is guaranteed that the graph does not contain multiple edges.Test case descriptions are separated with empty lines. The total value of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$500\,000$$$, and the total value of $$$m$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$500\,000$$$ as well.OutputFor each test case print a single integer — the required greatest common divisor     graphs      hashing      math      number theory      *2300
