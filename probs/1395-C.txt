C. Boboniu and Bit Operationstime 1 secondmemory 256 Boboniu likes bit operations. He wants to play a game with you.Boboniu gives you two sequences of non-negative integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ and $$$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_m$$$.For each $$$i$$$ ($$$1\le i\le n$$$), you're asked to choose a $$$j$$$ ($$$1\le j\le m$$$) and let $$$c_i=a_i\& b_j$$$, where $$$\&$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation. Note that you can pick the same $$$j$$$ for different $$$i$$$'s.Find the minimum possible $$$c_1 | c_2 | \ldots | c_n$$$, where $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise OR operation.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1\le n,m\le 200$$$).The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$0\le a_i < 2^9$$$).The next line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_m$$$ ($$$0\le b_i < 2^9$$$).OutputPrint one integer: the minimum possible $$$c_1 | c_2 | \ldots | c_n$$$.     bitmasks      brute force      dp      greedy      *1600
