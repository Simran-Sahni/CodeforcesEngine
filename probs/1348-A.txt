A. Phoenix and Balancetime 2  256 Phoenix has $$$n$$$ coins with weights $$$2^1, 2^2, \dots, 2^n$$$. He knows that $$$n$$$ is even.He wants to split the coins into two piles such that each pile has exactly $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ coins and the difference of weights between the two piles is minimized. Formally, let $$$a$$$ denote the sum of weights in the first pile, and $$$b$$$ denote the sum of weights in the second pile. Help Phoenix minimize $$$|a-b|$$$, the absolute value of $$$a-b$$$.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 30$$$; $$$n$$$ is even) — the number of coins that Phoenix has. OutputFor each test case, output one integer — the minimum possible difference of weights between the two piles     greedy      math      *800
