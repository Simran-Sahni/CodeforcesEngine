B. Dubious Cyrptotime 1 secondmemory 512 Pasha loves to send strictly positive integers to his friends. Pasha cares about security, therefore when he wants to send an integer $$$n$$$, he encrypts it in the following way: he picks three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ such that $$$l \leq a,b,c \leq r$$$, and then he computes the encrypted value $$$m = n \cdot a + b - c$$$.Unfortunately, an adversary intercepted the values $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ and $$$m$$$. Is it possible to recover the original values of $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ from this information? More formally, you are asked to find any values of $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ such that  $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ are integers,  $$$l \leq a, b, c \leq r$$$,  there exists a strictly positive integer $$$n$$$, such that $$$n \cdot a + b - c = m$$$. InputThe first line contains the only integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 20$$$) — the number of test cases. The following $$$t$$$ lines describe one test case each.Each test case consists of three integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq 500\,000$$$, $$$1 \leq m \leq 10^{10}$$$). The numbers are such that the answer to the problem exists.OutputFor each test case output three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ such that, $$$l \leq a, b, c \leq r$$$ and there exists a strictly positive integer $$$n$$$ such that $$$n \cdot a + b - c = m$$$. It is guaranteed that there is at least one possible solution, and you can output any possible combination if there are multiple solutions     binary search      brute force      math      number theory      *1500
