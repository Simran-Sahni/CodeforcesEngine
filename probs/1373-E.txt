E. Sum of Digitstime 2  512 Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the sum of digits of a decimal number $$$x$$$.Find the smallest non-negative integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$f(x) + f(x + 1) + \dots + f(x + k) = n$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 150$$$) â€” the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 150$$$, $$$0 \le k \le 9$$$). OutputFor each test case, print one integer without leading zeroes. If there is no such $$$x$$$ that $$$f(x) + f(x + 1) + \dots + f(x + k) = n$$$, print $$$-1$$$; otherwise, print the minimum $$$x$$$ meeting that constraint     brute force      constructive algorithms      dp      greedy      *2200
