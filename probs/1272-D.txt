D. Remove One Elementtime 2  256 You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers.You can remove at most one element from this array. Thus, the final length of the array is $$$n-1$$$ or $$$n$$$.Your task is to calculate the maximum possible length of the strictly increasing contiguous subarray of the remaining array.Recall that the contiguous subarray $$$a$$$ with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ is $$$a[l \dots r] = a_l, a_{l + 1}, \dots, a_r$$$. The subarray $$$a[l \dots r]$$$ is called strictly increasing if $$$a_l < a_{l+1} < \dots < a_r$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$.OutputPrint one integer — the maximum possible length of the strictly increasing contiguous subarray of the array $$$a$$$ after removing at most one element.     brute force      dp      *1500
