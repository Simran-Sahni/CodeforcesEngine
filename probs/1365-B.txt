B. Trouble Sorttime 1 secondmemory 256 Ashish has $$$n$$$ elements arranged in a line. These elements are represented by two integers $$$a_i$$$ — the value of the element and $$$b_i$$$ — the type of the element (there are only two possible types: $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$). He wants to sort the elements in non-decreasing values of $$$a_i$$$.He can perform the following operation any number of times:  Select any two elements $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$b_i \ne b_j$$$ and swap them. That is, he can only swap two elements of different types in one move. Tell him if he can sort the elements in non-decreasing values of $$$a_i$$$ after performing any number of operations.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \le t \le 100)$$$ — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \le n \le 500)$$$ — the size of the arrays.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ $$$(1 \le a_i \le 10^5)$$$  — the value of the $$$i$$$-th element.The third line containts $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_i$$$ $$$(b_i \in \{0, 1\})$$$  — the type of the $$$i$$$-th element.OutputFor each test case, print "Yes" or "No" (without quotes) depending on whether it is possible to sort elements in non-decreasing order of their value.You may print each letter in any case (upper or lower)     constructive algorithms      implementation      *1300
