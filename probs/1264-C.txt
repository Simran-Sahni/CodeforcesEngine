C. Beautiful Mirrors with queriestime 2  256 Creatnx has $$$n$$$ mirrors, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Every day, Creatnx asks exactly one mirror "Am I beautiful?". The $$$i$$$-th mirror will tell Creatnx that he is beautiful with probability $$$\frac{p_i}{100}$$$ for all $$$1 \le i \le n$$$.Some mirrors are called checkpoints. Initially, only the $$$1$$$st mirror is a checkpoint. It remains a checkpoint all the time.Creatnx asks the mirrors one by one, starting from the $$$1$$$-st mirror. Every day, if he asks $$$i$$$-th mirror, there are two possibilities:  The $$$i$$$-th mirror tells Creatnx that he is beautiful. In this case, if $$$i = n$$$ Creatnx will stop and become happy, otherwise he will continue asking the $$$i+1$$$-th mirror next day;  In the other case, Creatnx will feel upset. The next day, Creatnx will start asking from the checkpoint with a maximal number that is less or equal to $$$i$$$. There are some changes occur over time: some mirrors become new checkpoints and some mirrors are no longer checkpoints. You are given $$$q$$$ queries, each query is represented by an integer $$$u$$$: If the $$$u$$$-th mirror isn't a checkpoint then we set it as a checkpoint. Otherwise, the $$$u$$$-th mirror is no longer a checkpoint.After each query, you need to calculate the expected number of days until Creatnx becomes happy.Each of this numbers should be found by modulo $$$998244353$$$. Formally, let $$$M = 998244353$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \not \equiv 0 \pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \le x < M$$$ and $$$x \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \leq n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$)  — the number of mirrors and queries.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers: $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq p_i \leq 100$$$).Each of $$$q$$$ following lines contains a single integer $$$u$$$ ($$$2 \leq u \leq n$$$) — next query.OutputPrint $$$q$$$ numbers – the answers after each query by modulo $$$998244353$$$.     data structures      probabilities      *2400
