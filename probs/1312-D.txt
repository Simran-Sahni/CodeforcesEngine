D. Count the Arraystime 2  512 Your task is to calculate the number of arrays such that:  each array contains $$$n$$$ elements;  each element is an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$;  for each array, there is exactly one pair of equal elements;  for each array $$$a$$$, there exists an index $$$i$$$ such that the array is strictly ascending before the $$$i$$$-th element and strictly descending after it (formally, it means that $$$a_j < a_{j + 1}$$$, if $$$j < i$$$, and $$$a_j > a_{j + 1}$$$, if $$$j \ge i$$$). InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).OutputPrint one integer â€” the number of arrays that meet all of the aforementioned conditions, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.     combinatorics      math      *1700
