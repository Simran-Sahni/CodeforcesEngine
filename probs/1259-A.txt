A. Happy Birthday, Polycarp!time 1 secondmemory 256 Hooray! Polycarp turned $$$n$$$ years old! The Technocup Team sincerely congratulates Polycarp!Polycarp celebrated all of his $$$n$$$ birthdays: from the $$$1$$$-th to the $$$n$$$-th. At the moment, he is wondering: how many times he turned beautiful number of years?According to Polycarp, a positive integer is beautiful if it consists of only one digit repeated one or more times. For example, the following numbers are beautiful: $$$1$$$, $$$77$$$, $$$777$$$, $$$44$$$ and $$$999999$$$. The following numbers are not beautiful: $$$12$$$, $$$11110$$$, $$$6969$$$ and $$$987654321$$$.Of course, Polycarpus uses the decimal numeral system (i.e. radix is 10).Help Polycarpus to find the number of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (inclusive) that are beautiful.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the input. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case consists of one line, which contains a positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^9$$$) — how many years Polycarp has turned.OutputPrint $$$t$$$ integers — the answers to the given test cases in the order they are written in the test. Each answer is an integer: the number of beautiful years between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, inclusive     implementation      *1000
