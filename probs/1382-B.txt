B. Sequential Nimtime 1 secondmemory 256 There are $$$n$$$ piles of stones, where the $$$i$$$-th pile has $$$a_i$$$ stones. Two people play a game, where they take alternating turns removing stones.In a move, a player may remove a positive number of stones from the first non-empty pile (the pile with the minimal index, that has at least one stone). The first player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses the game. If both players play optimally, determine the winner of the game.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 1000$$$)  — the number of test cases. Next $$$2t$$$ lines contain descriptions of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 10^5$$$)  — the number of piles.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\le a_i\le 10^9$$$)  — $$$a_i$$$ is equal to the number of stones in the $$$i$$$-th pile.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, if the player who makes the first move will win, output "First". Otherwise, output "Second"     dp      games      *1100
