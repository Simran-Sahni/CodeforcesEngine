D. AND, OR and square sumtime 2  512 Gottfried learned about binary number representation. He then came up with this task and presented it to you.You are given a collection of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers $$$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$. You are allowed to perform the following operation: choose two distinct indices $$$1 \leq i, j \leq n$$$. If before the operation $$$a_i = x$$$, $$$a_j = y$$$, then after the operation $$$a_i = x~\mathsf{AND}~y$$$, $$$a_j = x~\mathsf{OR}~y$$$, where $$$\mathsf{AND}$$$ and $$$\mathsf{OR}$$$ are bitwise AND and OR respectively (refer to the Notes section for formal description). The operation may be performed any number of times (possibly zero).After all operations are done, compute $$$\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2$$$ — the sum of squares of all $$$a_i$$$. What is the largest sum of squares you can achieve?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_i < 2^{20}$$$).OutputPrint a single integer — the largest possible sum of squares that can be achieved after several (possibly zero) operations.     bitmasks      greedy      math      *1700
