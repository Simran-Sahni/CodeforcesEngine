C. Multiples of Lengthtime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers.You want to make all elements of $$$a$$$ equal to zero by doing the following operation exactly three times:  Select a segment, for each number in this segment we can add a multiple of $$$len$$$ to it, where $$$len$$$ is the length of this segment (added integers can be different). It can be proven that it is always possible to make all elements of $$$a$$$ equal to zero.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100\,000$$$): the number of elements of the array.The second line contains $$$n$$$ elements of an array $$$a$$$ separated by spaces: $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).OutputThe output should contain six lines representing three operations.For each operation, print two lines:  The first line contains two integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$): the bounds of the selected segment.  The second line contains $$$r-l+1$$$ integers $$$b_l, b_{l+1}, \dots, b_r$$$ ($$$-10^{18} \le b_i \le 10^{18}$$$): the numbers to add to $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r$$$, respectively; $$$b_i$$$ should be divisible by $$$r - l + 1$$$.     constructive algorithms      greedy      math      number theory      *1600
