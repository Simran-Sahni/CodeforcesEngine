C. String Transformation 2time 3  256 Note that the only difference between String Transformation 1 and String Transformation 2 is in the move Koa does. In this version the letter $$$y$$$ Koa selects can be any letter from the first $$$20$$$ lowercase letters of English alphabet (read statement for better understanding). You can make hacks in these problems independently.Koa the Koala has two strings $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ of the same length $$$n$$$ ($$$|A|=|B|=n$$$) consisting of the first $$$20$$$ lowercase English alphabet letters (ie. from a to t).In one move Koa:  selects some subset of positions $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$$$ ($$$k \ge 1; 1 \le p_i \le n; p_i \neq p_j$$$ if $$$i \neq j$$$) of $$$A$$$ such that $$$A_{p_1} = A_{p_2} = \ldots = A_{p_k} = x$$$ (ie. all letters on this positions are equal to some letter $$$x$$$).  selects any letter $$$y$$$ (from the first $$$20$$$ lowercase letters in English alphabet).  sets each letter in positions $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$$$ to letter $$$y$$$. More formally: for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le k$$$) Koa sets $$$A_{p_i} = y$$$. Note that you can only modify letters in string $$$A$$$.Koa wants to know the smallest number of moves she has to do to make strings equal to each other ($$$A = B$$$) or to determine that there is no way to make them equal. Help her!InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the length of strings $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$.The second line of each test case contains string $$$A$$$ ($$$|A|=n$$$).The third line of each test case contains string $$$B$$$ ($$$|B|=n$$$).Both strings consists of the first $$$20$$$ lowercase English alphabet letters (ie. from a to t).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case:Print on a single line the smallest number of moves she has to do to make strings equal to each other ($$$A = B$$$) or $$$-1$$$ if there is no way to make them equal     bitmasks      dp      graphs      trees      *3100
