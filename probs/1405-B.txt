B. Array Cancellationtime 1 secondmemory 256 You're given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers, such that $$$a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = 0$$$.In one operation, you can choose two different indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le i, j \le n$$$), decrement $$$a_i$$$ by one and increment $$$a_j$$$ by one. If $$$i < j$$$ this operation is free, otherwise it costs one coin.How many coins do you have to spend in order to make all elements equal to $$$0$$$?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5000$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$)  — the number of elements.The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$). It is given that $$$\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 0$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the minimum number of coins we have to spend in order to make all elements equal to $$$0$$$     constructive algorithms      implementation      *1000
