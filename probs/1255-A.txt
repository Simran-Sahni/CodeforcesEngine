A. Changing Volumetime 1 secondmemory 256 Bob watches TV every day. He always sets the volume of his TV to $$$b$$$. However, today he is angry to find out someone has changed the volume to $$$a$$$. Of course, Bob has a remote control that can change the volume.There are six buttons ($$$-5, -2, -1, +1, +2, +5$$$) on the control, which in one press can either increase or decrease the current volume by $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, or $$$5$$$. The volume can be arbitrarily large, but can never be negative. In other words, Bob cannot press the button if it causes the volume to be lower than $$$0$$$.As Bob is so angry, he wants to change the volume to $$$b$$$ using as few button presses as possible. However, he forgets how to do such simple calculations, so he asks you for help. Write a program that given $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, finds the minimum number of presses to change the TV volume from $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \le T \le 1\,000$$$). Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.Each test case consists of one line containing two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$0 \le a, b \le 10^{9}$$$) — the current volume and Bob's desired volume, respectively.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of presses to change the TV volume from $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$. If Bob does not need to change the volume (i.e. $$$a=b$$$), then print $$$0$$$     math      *800
