G. Cow and Exercisetime 1 secondmemory 256 Farmer John is obsessed with making Bessie exercise more!Bessie is out grazing on the farm, which consists of $$$n$$$ fields connected by $$$m$$$ directed roads. Each road takes some time $$$w_i$$$ to cross. She is currently at field $$$1$$$ and will return to her home at field $$$n$$$ at the end of the day.Farmer John has plans to increase the time it takes to cross certain roads. He can increase the time it takes to cross each road by a nonnegative amount, but the total increase cannot exceed $$$x_i$$$ for the $$$i$$$-th plan. Determine the maximum he can make the shortest path from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ for each of the $$$q$$$ independent plans.InputThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 50$$$, $$$1 \le m \le n \cdot (n-1)$$$) â€” the number of fields and number of roads, respectively.Each of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains $$$3$$$ integers, $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$, and $$$w_i$$$ ($$$1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$$$, $$$1 \le w_i \le 10^6$$$), meaning there is an road from field $$$u_i$$$ to field $$$v_i$$$ that takes $$$w_i$$$ time to cross.It is guaranteed that there exists a way to get to field $$$n$$$ from field $$$1$$$. It is guaranteed that the graph does not contain self-loops or parallel edges. It is possible to have a road from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ and a road from $$$v$$$ to $$$u$$$.The next line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 10^5$$$), the number of plans.Each of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$x_i$$$, the query ($$$0 \le x_i \le 10^5$$$).OutputFor each query, output the maximum Farmer John can make the shortest path if the total increase does not exceed $$$x_i$$$.Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$.Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $$$\frac{|a - b|}{\max{(1, |b|)}} \le 10^{-6}$$$     flows      graphs      shortest paths      *3100
