E. Strange Operationtime 1 secondmemory 256 Koa the Koala has a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Koa can perform no more than $$$n-1$$$ (possibly zero) operations of the following form:In one operation Koa selects positions $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$ for some $$$i$$$ with $$$1 \le i < |s|$$$ and sets $$$s_i$$$ to $$$max(s_i, s_{i+1})$$$. Then Koa deletes position $$$i+1$$$ from $$$s$$$ (after the removal, the remaining parts are concatenated).Note that after every operation the length of $$$s$$$ decreases by $$$1$$$.How many different binary strings can Koa obtain by doing no more than $$$n-1$$$ (possibly zero) operations modulo $$$10^9+7$$$ ($$$1000000007$$$)?InputThe only line of input contains binary string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le 10^6$$$). For all $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le |s|$$$) $$$s_i = 0$$$ or $$$s_i = 1$$$.OutputOn a single line print the answer to the problem modulo $$$10^9+7$$$ ($$$1000000007$$$).     combinatorics      data structures      dp      *2800
