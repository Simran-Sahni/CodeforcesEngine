So he created a problem about the sequence that you can't find in OEIS: You are given two integers $$$d, m$$$, find the number of arrays $$$a$$$, satisfying the following constraints:  The length of $$$a$$$ is $$$n$$$, $$$n \ge 1$$$  $$$1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le d$$$  Define an array $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ as follows: $$$b_1 = a_1$$$, $$$\forall i > 1, b_i = b_{i - 1} \oplus a_i$$$, where $$$\oplus$$$ is the bitwise exclusive-or (xor). After constructing an array $$$b$$$, the constraint $$$b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_{n - 1} < b_n$$$ should hold. Since the number of possible arrays may be too large, you need to find the answer modulo $$$m$$$.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) denoting the number of test cases in the input.Each of the next $$$t$$$ lines contains two integers $$$d, m$$$ ($$$1 \leq d, m \leq 10^9$$$).Note that $$$m$$$ is not necessary the prime!OutputFor each test case, print the number of arrays $$$a$$$, satisfying all given constrains, modulo $$$m$$$     bitmasks      combinatorics      math      *1700
