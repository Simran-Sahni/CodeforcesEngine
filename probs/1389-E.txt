E. Calendar Ambiguitytime 2  256 Berland year consists of $$$m$$$ months with $$$d$$$ days each. Months are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. Berland week consists of $$$w$$$ days. The first day of the year is also the first day of the week. Note that the last week of the year might be shorter than $$$w$$$ days.A pair $$$(x, y)$$$ such that $$$x < y$$$ is ambiguous if day $$$x$$$ of month $$$y$$$ is the same day of the week as day $$$y$$$ of month $$$x$$$.Count the number of ambiguous pairs.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of testcases.Each of the next $$$t$$$ lines contains three integers $$$m$$$, $$$d$$$ and $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \le m, d, w \le 10^9$$$) — the number of months in a year, the number of days in a month and the number of days in a week.OutputPrint $$$t$$$ integers — for each testcase output the number of pairs $$$(x, y)$$$ such that $$$x < y$$$ and day $$$x$$$ of month $$$y$$$ is the same day of the week as day $$$y$$$ of month $$$x$$$     math      number theory      *2200
