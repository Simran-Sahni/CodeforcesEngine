A. Yet Another Tetris Problemtime 2  256 You are given some Tetris field consisting of $$$n$$$ columns. The initial height of the $$$i$$$-th column of the field is $$$a_i$$$ blocks. On top of these columns you can place only figures of size $$$2 \times 1$$$ (i.e. the height of this figure is $$$2$$$ blocks and the width of this figure is $$$1$$$ block). Note that you cannot rotate these figures.Your task is to say if you can clear the whole field by placing such figures.More formally, the problem can be described like this:The following process occurs while at least one $$$a_i$$$ is greater than $$$0$$$:  You place one figure $$$2 \times 1$$$ (choose some $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$a_i + 2$$$);  then, while all $$$a_i$$$ are greater than zero, replace each $$$a_i$$$ with $$$a_i - 1$$$. And your task is to determine if it is possible to clear the whole field (i.e. finish the described process), choosing the places for new figures properly.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The next $$$2t$$$ lines describe test cases. The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$) — the number of columns in the Tetris field. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 100$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the initial height of the $$$i$$$-th column of the Tetris field.OutputFor each test case, print the answer — "YES" (without quotes) if you can clear the whole Tetris field and "NO" otherwise     implementation      number theory      *900
