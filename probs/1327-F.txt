F. AND Segmentstime 3  256 You are given three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$m$$$ conditions $$$(l_1, r_1, x_1), (l_2, r_2, x_2), \dots, (l_m, r_m, x_m)$$$.Calculate the number of distinct arrays $$$a$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ integers such that:   $$$0 \le a_i < 2^k$$$ for each $$$1 \le i \le n$$$;  bitwise AND of numbers $$$a[l_i] \& a[l_i + 1] \& \dots \& a[r_i] = x_i$$$ for each $$$1 \le i \le m$$$. Two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are considered different if there exists such a position $$$i$$$ that $$$a_i \neq b_i$$$. The number can be pretty large so print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le k \le 30$$$, $$$0 \le m \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$, the value such that all numbers in $$$a$$$ should be smaller than $$$2^k$$$ and the number of conditions, respectively.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains the description of a condition $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$ and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$$$, $$$0 \le x_i < 2^k$$$) — the borders of the condition segment and the required bitwise AND value on it.OutputPrint a single integer — the number of distinct arrays $$$a$$$ that satisfy all the above conditions modulo $$$998244353$$$.     bitmasks      combinatorics      data structures      dp      two pointers      *2500
