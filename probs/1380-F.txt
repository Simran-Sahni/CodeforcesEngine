F. Strange Additiontime 5  256 Let $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ be some non-negative integers. Let's define strange addition of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ as following:  write down the numbers one under another and align them by their least significant digit;  add them up digit by digit and concatenate the respective sums together. Assume that both numbers have an infinite number of leading zeros.For example, let's take a look at a strange addition of numbers $$$3248$$$ and $$$908$$$:  You are given a string $$$c$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$. You are also given $$$m$$$ updates of form:   $$$x~d$$$ — replace the digit at the $$$x$$$-th position of $$$c$$$ with a digit $$$d$$$. Note that string $$$c$$$ might have leading zeros at any point of time.After each update print the number of pairs $$$(a, b)$$$ such that both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are non-negative integers and the result of a strange addition of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ is equal to $$$c$$$.Note that the numbers of pairs can be quite large, so print them modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the number $$$c$$$ and the number of updates.The second line contains a string $$$c$$$, consisting of exactly $$$n$$$ digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \le x \le n$$$, $$$0 \le d \le 9$$$) — the descriptions of updates.OutputPrint $$$m$$$ integers — the $$$i$$$-th value should be equal to the number of pairs $$$(a, b)$$$ such that both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are non-negative integers and the result of a strange addition of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ is equal to $$$c$$$ after $$$i$$$ updates are applied.Note that the numbers of pairs can be quite large, so print them modulo $$$998244353$$$     data structures      dp      matrices      *2600
