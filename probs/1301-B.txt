B. Motarack's Birthdaytime 2  256 Dark is going to attend Motarack's birthday. Dark decided that the gift he is going to give to Motarack is an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers.Dark created that array $$$1000$$$ years ago, so some elements in that array disappeared. Dark knows that Motarack hates to see an array that has two adjacent elements with a high absolute difference between them. He doesn't have much time so he wants to choose an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \leq k \leq 10^{9}$$$) and replaces all missing elements in the array $$$a$$$ with $$$k$$$.Let $$$m$$$ be the maximum absolute difference between all adjacent elements (i.e. the maximum value of $$$|a_i - a_{i+1}|$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq n - 1$$$) in the array $$$a$$$ after Dark replaces all missing elements with $$$k$$$.Dark should choose an integer $$$k$$$ so that $$$m$$$ is minimized. Can you help him?InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 10^{5}$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-1 \leq a_i \leq 10 ^ {9}$$$). If $$$a_i = -1$$$, then the $$$i$$$-th integer is missing. It is guaranteed that at least one integer is missing in every test case.It is guaranteed, that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$4 \cdot 10 ^ {5}$$$.OutputPrint the answers for each test case in the following format:You should print two integers, the minimum possible value of $$$m$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \leq k \leq 10^{9}$$$) that makes the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements in the array $$$a$$$ equal to $$$m$$$.Make sure that after replacing all the missing elements with $$$k$$$, the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements becomes $$$m$$$.If there is more than one possible $$$k$$$, you can print any of them     binary search      greedy      ternary search      *1500
