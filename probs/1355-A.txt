A. Sequence with Digitstime 1 secondmemory 256 Let's define the following recurrence: $$$$$$a_{n+1} = a_{n} + minDigit(a_{n}) \cdot maxDigit(a_{n}).$$$$$$Here $$$minDigit(x)$$$ and $$$maxDigit(x)$$$ are the minimal and maximal digits in the decimal representation of $$$x$$$ without leading zeroes. For examples refer to notes.Your task is calculate $$$a_{K}$$$ for given $$$a_{1}$$$ and $$$K$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of independent test cases.Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers $$$a_{1}$$$ and $$$K$$$ ($$$1 \le a_{1} \le 10^{18}$$$, $$$1 \le K \le 10^{16}$$$) separated by a space.OutputFor each test case print one integer $$$a_{K}$$$ on a separate line     brute force      implementation      math      *1200
