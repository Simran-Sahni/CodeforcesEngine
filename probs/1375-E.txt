E. Inversion SwapSorttime 2  256 Madeline has an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. A pair $$$(u, v)$$$ of integers forms an inversion in $$$a$$$ if:  $$$1 \le u < v \le n$$$.  $$$a_u > a_v$$$. Madeline recently found a magical paper, which allows her to write two indices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ and swap the values $$$a_u$$$ and $$$a_v$$$. Being bored, she decided to write a list of pairs $$$(u_i, v_i)$$$ with the following conditions:  all the pairs in the list are distinct and form an inversion in $$$a$$$.  all the pairs that form an inversion in $$$a$$$ are in the list.  Starting from the given array, if you swap the values at indices $$$u_1$$$ and $$$v_1$$$, then the values at indices $$$u_2$$$ and $$$v_2$$$ and so on, then after all pairs are processed, the array $$$a$$$ will be sorted in non-decreasing order. Construct such a list or determine that no such list exists. If there are multiple possible answers, you may find any of them.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 1000$$$) — the length of the array.Next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,...,a_n$$$ $$$(1 \le a_i \le 10^9)$$$  — elements of the array.OutputPrint -1 if no such list exists. Otherwise in the first line you should print a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \le m \le \dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}$$$) — number of pairs in the list.The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$m$$$ lines should contain two integers $$$u_i, v_i$$$ ($$$1 \le u_i < v_i\le n$$$).If there are multiple possible answers, you may find any of them.     constructive algorithms      greedy      sortings      *2500
