B. Most socially-distanced subsequencetime 1 secondmemory 256 Given a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$, find its subsequence $$$s_1$$$, $$$s_2$$$, $$$\ldots$$$, $$$s_k$$$ of length at least $$$2$$$ such that:  $$$|s_1-s_2|+|s_2-s_3|+\ldots+|s_{k-1}-s_k|$$$ is as big as possible over all subsequences of $$$p$$$ with length at least $$$2$$$.  Among all such subsequences, choose the one whose length, $$$k$$$, is as small as possible. If multiple subsequences satisfy these conditions, you are allowed to find any of them.A sequence $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of an array $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deleting some (possibly, zero or all) elements.A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array of length $$$n$$$ in which every element from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ occurs exactly once.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutation $$$p$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$, $$$\ldots$$$, $$$p_{n}$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le n$$$, $$$p_i$$$ are distinct) — the elements of the permutation $$$p$$$.The sum of $$$n$$$ across the test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, the first line should contain the length of the found subsequence, $$$k$$$. The second line should contain $$$s_1$$$, $$$s_2$$$, $$$\ldots$$$, $$$s_k$$$ — its elements.If multiple subsequences satisfy these conditions, you are allowed to find any of them     greedy      two pointers      *1300
