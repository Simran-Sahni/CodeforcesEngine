C. Make It Goodtime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. You have to find the length of the smallest (shortest) prefix of elements you need to erase from $$$a$$$ to make it a good array. Recall that the prefix of the array $$$a=[a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]$$$ is a subarray consisting several first elements: the prefix of the array $$$a$$$ of length $$$k$$$ is the array $$$[a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k]$$$ ($$$0 \le k \le n$$$).The array $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$ is called good, if you can obtain a non-decreasing array $$$c$$$ ($$$c_1 \le c_2 \le \dots \le c_{m}$$$) from it, repeating the following operation $$$m$$$ times (initially, $$$c$$$ is empty):  select either the first or the last element of $$$b$$$, remove it from $$$b$$$, and append it to the end of the array $$$c$$$. For example, if we do $$$4$$$ operations: take $$$b_1$$$, then $$$b_{m}$$$, then $$$b_{m-1}$$$ and at last $$$b_2$$$, then $$$b$$$ becomes $$$[b_3, b_4, \dots, b_{m-3}]$$$ and $$$c =[b_1, b_{m}, b_{m-1}, b_2]$$$.Consider the following example: $$$b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 1]$$$. This array is good because we can obtain non-decreasing array $$$c$$$ from it by the following sequence of operations:  take the first element of $$$b$$$, so $$$b = [2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 1]$$$, $$$c = [1]$$$;  take the last element of $$$b$$$, so $$$b = [2, 3, 4, 4, 2]$$$, $$$c = [1, 1]$$$;  take the last element of $$$b$$$, so $$$b = [2, 3, 4, 4]$$$, $$$c = [1, 1, 2]$$$;  take the first element of $$$b$$$, so $$$b = [3, 4, 4]$$$, $$$c = [1, 1, 2, 2]$$$;  take the first element of $$$b$$$, so $$$b = [4, 4]$$$, $$$c = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]$$$;  take the last element of $$$b$$$, so $$$b = [4]$$$, $$$c = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]$$$;  take the only element of $$$b$$$, so $$$b = []$$$, $$$c = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]$$$ — $$$c$$$ is non-decreasing. Note that the array consisting of one element is good.Print the length of the shortest prefix of $$$a$$$ to delete (erase), to make $$$a$$$ to be a good array. Note that the required length can be $$$0$$$.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer: the length of the shortest prefix of elements you need to erase from $$$a$$$ to make it a good array     greedy      *1200
