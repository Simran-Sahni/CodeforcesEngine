B. Candies Divisiontime 2  256 Santa has $$$n$$$ candies and he wants to gift them to $$$k$$$ kids. He wants to divide as many candies as possible between all $$$k$$$ kids. Santa can't divide one candy into parts but he is allowed to not use some candies at all.Suppose the kid who recieves the minimum number of candies has $$$a$$$ candies and the kid who recieves the maximum number of candies has $$$b$$$ candies. Then Santa will be satisfied, if the both conditions are met at the same time:  $$$b - a \le 1$$$ (it means $$$b = a$$$ or $$$b = a + 1$$$);  the number of kids who has $$$a+1$$$ candies (note that $$$a+1$$$ not necessarily equals $$$b$$$) does not exceed $$$\lfloor\frac{k}{2}\rfloor$$$ (less than or equal to $$$\lfloor\frac{k}{2}\rfloor$$$). $$$\lfloor\frac{k}{2}\rfloor$$$ is $$$k$$$ divided by $$$2$$$ and rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if $$$k=5$$$ then $$$\lfloor\frac{k}{2}\rfloor=\lfloor\frac{5}{2}\rfloor=2$$$.Your task is to find the maximum number of candies Santa can give to kids so that he will be satisfied.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The next $$$t$$$ lines describe test cases. The $$$i$$$-th test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n, k \le 10^9$$$) — the number of candies and the number of kids.OutputFor each test case print the answer on it — the maximum number of candies Santa can give to kids so that he will be satisfied     math      *900
