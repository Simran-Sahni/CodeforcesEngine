A. Add Odd or Subtract Eventime 2  256 You are given two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.In one move, you can change $$$a$$$ in the following way:  Choose any positive odd integer $$$x$$$ ($$$x > 0$$$) and replace $$$a$$$ with $$$a+x$$$;  choose any positive even integer $$$y$$$ ($$$y > 0$$$) and replace $$$a$$$ with $$$a-y$$$. You can perform as many such operations as you want. You can choose the same numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ in different moves.Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain $$$b$$$ from $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that you can always obtain $$$b$$$ from $$$a$$$.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. Each test case is given as two space-separated integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b \le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer — the minimum number of moves required to obtain $$$b$$$ from $$$a$$$ if you can perform any number of moves described in the problem statement. It is guaranteed that you can always obtain $$$b$$$ from $$$a$$$     greedy      implementation      math      *800
