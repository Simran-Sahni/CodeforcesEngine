A. Even Subset Sum Problemtime 1 secondmemory 512 You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers. Find a non-empty subset of its elements such that their sum is even (i.e. divisible by $$$2$$$) or determine that there is no such subset.Both the given array and required subset may contain equal values.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$), number of test cases to solve. Descriptions of $$$t$$$ test cases follow.A description of each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 100$$$), length of array $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 100$$$), elements of $$$a$$$. The given array $$$a$$$ can contain equal values (duplicates).OutputFor each test case output $$$-1$$$ if there is no such subset of elements. Otherwise output positive integer $$$k$$$, number of elements in the required subset. Then output $$$k$$$ distinct integers ($$$1 \leq p_i \leq n$$$), indexes of the chosen elements. If there are multiple solutions output any of them     brute force      dp      greedy      implementation      *800
