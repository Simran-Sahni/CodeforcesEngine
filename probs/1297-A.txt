A. Likes Displaytime 3  256 Polycarp is working on the implementation of displaying likes on the Codehorses social network. The number of likes should be displayed in a format that will be easy to read by users. It was decided that for large numbers of likes the format should be like 123K (one hundred twenty-three thousand) or like 56M (fifty-six million).The following displaying strategy has been approved:  the number will be displayed either as an integer number from 0 to 999, or as a positive integer number of thousands (from 1K to 999K), or as a positive integer number of millions (from 1M on),  the specified exact number of likes $$$n$$$ when displaying should be rounded to the nearest view from the case above (if rounding is ambiguous, it must be rounded up): for example, $$$1785$$$ should be rounded to 2K instead of 1K, $$$4500000$$$ should be rounded to 5M. Help Polycarp implement this part of the functionality: for a given non-negative integer number of likes $$$n$$$, print its view in the Codehorses interface.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases in the input. The following are descriptions of the $$$t$$$ input test cases, one per line.The description of each test case consists of a single line that contains a non-negative integer $$$n$$$ ($$$0 \le n \le 2\cdot10^9$$$) — the number of likes.OutputPrint $$$t$$$ answers to the given test cases in the order from the input. Each printed value must have one of the following types:  either an integer from 0 to 999 which corresponds just to the number of likes,  or a number of thousands from 1K to 999K,  or a number of millions from 1M to 2000M. The answer is equal to a view which is the closest (by difference) to the given number $$$n$$$. If this rounding is ambiguous, then round answer up (to a greater value)     *special problem      implementation
