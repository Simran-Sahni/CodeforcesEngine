E. Tree Queriestime 2  256 You are given a rooted tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The root of the tree is a vertex number $$$1$$$.A tree is a connected undirected graph with $$$n-1$$$ edges.You are given $$$m$$$ queries. The $$$i$$$-th query consists of the set of $$$k_i$$$ distinct vertices $$$v_i[1], v_i[2], \dots, v_i[k_i]$$$. Your task is to say if there is a path from the root to some vertex $$$u$$$ such that each of the given $$$k$$$ vertices is either belongs to this path or has the distance $$$1$$$ to some vertex of this path.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of queries.Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines describes an edge of the tree. Edge $$$i$$$ is denoted by two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$, the labels of vertices it connects $$$(1 \le u_i, v_i \le n, u_i \ne v_i$$$).It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.The next $$$m$$$ lines describe queries. The $$$i$$$-th line describes the $$$i$$$-th query and starts with the integer $$$k_i$$$ ($$$1 \le k_i \le n$$$) — the number of vertices in the current query. Then $$$k_i$$$ integers follow: $$$v_i[1], v_i[2], \dots, v_i[k_i]$$$ ($$$1 \le v_i[j] \le n$$$), where $$$v_i[j]$$$ is the $$$j$$$-th vertex of the $$$i$$$-th query.It is guaranteed that all vertices in a single query are distinct.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k_i$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} k_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each query, print the answer — "YES", if there is a path from the root to some vertex $$$u$$$ such that each of the given $$$k$$$ vertices is either belongs to this path or has the distance $$$1$$$ to some vertex of this path and "NO" otherwise     dfs and similar      graphs      trees      *1900
