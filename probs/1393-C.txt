She likes having fun so she decided not to simply eat the patty-cakes but to try not to eat the patty-cakes with the same filling way too often. To achieve this she wants the minimum distance between the eaten with the same filling to be the largest possible. Herein Pinkie Pie called the distance between two patty-cakes the number of eaten patty-cakes strictly between them.Pinkie Pie can eat the patty-cakes in any order. She is impatient about eating all the patty-cakes up so she asks you to help her to count the greatest minimum distance between the eaten patty-cakes with the same filling amongst all possible orders of eating!Pinkie Pie is going to buy more bags of patty-cakes so she asks you to solve this problem for several bags!InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \le T \le 100$$$): the number of bags for which you need to solve the problem.The first line of each bag description contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$): the number of patty-cakes in it. The second line of the bag description contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$): the information of patty-cakes' fillings: same fillings are defined as same integers, different fillings are defined as different integers. It is guaranteed that each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all bags does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each bag print in separate line one single integer: the largest minimum distance between the eaten patty-cakes with the same filling amongst all possible orders of eating for that bag     constructive algorithms      greedy      math      sortings      *1700
