D1. Prefix-Suffix Palindrome (Easy version)time 2  256 This is the easy version of the problem. The difference is the constraint on the sum of lengths of strings and the number of test cases. You can make hacks only if you solve all versions of this task.You are given a string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters. Find the longest string, $$$t$$$, which satisfies the following conditions:   The length of $$$t$$$ does not exceed the length of $$$s$$$.  $$$t$$$ is a palindrome.  There exists two strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ (possibly empty), such that $$$t = a + b$$$ ( "$$$+$$$" represents concatenation), and $$$a$$$ is prefix of $$$s$$$ while $$$b$$$ is suffix of $$$s$$$. InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$), the number of test cases. The next $$$t$$$ lines each describe a test case.Each test case is a non-empty string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the longest string which satisfies the conditions described above. If there exists multiple possible solutions, print any of them     hashing      string suffix structures      strings      *1500
