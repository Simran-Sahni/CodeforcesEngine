E. Special Permutationtime 2  256 A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array $$$p=[p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n]$$$, which contains every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (inclusive) and, moreover, each number appears exactly once. For example, $$$p=[3,1,4,2,5]$$$ is a permutation of length $$$5$$$.For a given number $$$n$$$ ($$$n \ge 2$$$), find a permutation $$$p$$$ in which absolute difference (that is, the absolute value of difference) of any two neighboring (adjacent) elements is between $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$, inclusive. Formally, find such permutation $$$p$$$ that $$$2 \le |p_i - p_{i+1}| \le 4$$$ for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i < n$$$).Print any such permutation for the given integer $$$n$$$ or determine that it does not exist.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) â€” the number of test cases in the input. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case is described by a single line containing an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 1000$$$).OutputPrint $$$t$$$ lines. Print a permutation that meets the given requirements. If there are several such permutations, then print any of them. If no such permutation exists, print -1     *special problem      constructive algorithms      *1600
