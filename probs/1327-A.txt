A. Sum of Odd Integerstime 2  256 You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. Your task is to find if $$$n$$$ can be represented as a sum of $$$k$$$ distinct positive odd (not divisible by $$$2$$$) integers or not.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases.The next $$$t$$$ lines describe test cases. The only line of the test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n, k \le 10^7$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer — "YES" (without quotes) if $$$n$$$ can be represented as a sum of $$$k$$$ distinct positive odd (not divisible by $$$2$$$) integers and "NO" otherwise     math      *1100
