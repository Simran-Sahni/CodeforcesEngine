D. Three Sequencestime 2  512 You are given a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$.You have to construct two sequences of integers $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ with length $$$n$$$ that satisfy:  for every $$$i$$$ ($$$1\leq i\leq n$$$) $$$b_i+c_i=a_i$$$  $$$b$$$ is non-decreasing, which means that for every $$$1<i\leq n$$$, $$$b_i\geq b_{i-1}$$$ must hold  $$$c$$$ is non-increasing, which means that for every $$$1<i\leq n$$$, $$$c_i\leq c_{i-1}$$$ must hold You have to minimize $$$\max(b_i,c_i)$$$. In other words, you have to minimize the maximum number in sequences $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$.Also there will be $$$q$$$ changes, the $$$i$$$-th change is described by three integers $$$l,r,x$$$. You should add $$$x$$$ to $$$a_l,a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r$$$. You have to find the minimum possible value of $$$\max(b_i,c_i)$$$ for the initial sequence and for sequence after each change.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\leq n\leq 10^5$$$).The secound line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\leq i\leq n$$$, $$$-10^9\leq a_i\leq 10^9$$$).The third line contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1\leq q\leq 10^5$$$).Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l,r,x$$$ ($$$1\leq l\leq r\leq n,-10^9\leq x\leq 10^9$$$), desribing the next change. OutputPrint $$$q+1$$$ lines.On the $$$i$$$-th ($$$1 \leq i \leq q+1$$$) line, print the answer to the problem for the sequence after $$$i-1$$$ changes.     constructive algorithms      data structures      greedy      math      *2200
