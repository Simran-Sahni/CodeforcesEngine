F. Jog Around The Graphtime 2  256 You are given a simple weighted connected undirected graph, consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges.A path in the graph of length $$$k$$$ is a sequence of $$$k+1$$$ vertices $$$v_1, v_2, \dots, v_{k+1}$$$ such that for each $$$i$$$ $$$(1 \le i \le k)$$$ the edge $$$(v_i, v_{i+1})$$$ is present in the graph. A path from some vertex $$$v$$$ also has vertex $$$v_1=v$$$. Note that edges and vertices are allowed to be included in the path multiple times.The weight of the path is the total weight of edges in it.For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$q$$$ consider a path from vertex $$$1$$$ of length $$$i$$$ of the maximum weight. What is the sum of weights of these $$$q$$$ paths?Answer can be quite large, so print it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.InputThe first line contains a three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2000$$$; $$$n - 1 \le m \le 2000$$$; $$$m \le q \le 10^9$$$) — the number of vertices in the graph, the number of edges in the graph and the number of lengths that should be included in the answer.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains a description of an edge: three integers $$$v$$$, $$$u$$$, $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \le v, u \le n$$$; $$$1 \le w \le 10^6$$$) — two vertices $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ are connected by an undirected edge with weight $$$w$$$. The graph contains no loops and no multiple edges. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a connected graph.OutputPrint a single integer — the sum of the weights of the paths from vertex $$$1$$$ of maximum weights of lengths $$$1, 2, \dots, q$$$ modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.     binary search      dp      geometry      graphs      *2700
