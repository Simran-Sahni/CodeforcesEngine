A. ConneR and the A.R.C. Markland-Ntime 1 secondmemory 256 Sakuzyo - ImprintingA.R.C. Markland-N is a tall building with $$$n$$$ floors numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Between each two adjacent floors in the building, there is a staircase connecting them.It's lunchtime for our sensei Colin "ConneR" Neumann Jr, and he's planning for a location to enjoy his meal.ConneR's office is at floor $$$s$$$ of the building. On each floor (including floor $$$s$$$, of course), there is a restaurant offering meals. However, due to renovations being in progress, $$$k$$$ of the restaurants are currently closed, and as a result, ConneR can't enjoy his lunch there.CooneR wants to reach a restaurant as quickly as possible to save time. What is the minimum number of staircases he needs to walk to reach a closest currently open restaurant.Please answer him quickly, and you might earn his praise and even enjoy the lunch with him in the elegant Neumanns' way!InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases in the test. Then the descriptions of $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of a test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$s$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \le s \le n$$$, $$$1 \le k \le \min(n-1, 1000)$$$) — respectively the number of floors of A.R.C. Markland-N, the floor where ConneR is in, and the number of closed restaurants.The second line of a test case contains $$$k$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) — the floor numbers of the currently closed restaurants.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.OutputFor each test case print a single integer — the minimum number of staircases required for ConneR to walk from the floor $$$s$$$ to a floor with an open restaurant     binary search      brute force      implementation      *1100
