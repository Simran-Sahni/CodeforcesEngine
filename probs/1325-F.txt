F. Ehab's Last Theoremtime 1 secondmemory 256 It's the year 5555. You have a graph, and you want to find a long cycle and a huge independent set, just because you can. But for now, let's just stick with finding either.Given a connected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices, you can choose to either:  find an independent set that has exactly $$$\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil$$$ vertices. find a simple cycle of length at least $$$\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil$$$. An independent set is a set of vertices such that no two of them are connected by an edge. A simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice. I have a proof you can always solve one of these problems, but it's too long to fit this margin.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$5 \le n \le 10^5$$$, $$$n-1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two space-separated integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le u,v \le n$$$) that mean there's an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It's guaranteed that the graph is connected and doesn't contain any self-loops or multiple edges.OutputIf you choose to solve the first problem, then on the first line print "1", followed by a line containing $$$\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil$$$ distinct integers not exceeding $$$n$$$, the vertices in the desired independent set.If you, however, choose to solve the second problem, then on the first line print "2", followed by a line containing one integer, $$$c$$$, representing the length of the found cycle, followed by a line containing $$$c$$$ distinct integers integers not exceeding $$$n$$$, the vertices in the desired cycle, in the order they appear in the cycle.     constructive algorithms      dfs and similar      graphs      greedy      *2500
