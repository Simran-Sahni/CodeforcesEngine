A. Suborraystime 1 secondmemory 256 A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).For a positive integer $$$n$$$, we call a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ good if the following condition holds for every pair $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le j \le n$$$) —   $$$(p_i \text{ OR } p_{i+1} \text{ OR } \ldots \text{ OR } p_{j-1} \text{ OR } p_{j}) \ge j-i+1$$$, where $$$\text{OR}$$$ denotes the bitwise OR operation. In other words, a permutation $$$p$$$ is good if for every subarray of $$$p$$$, the $$$\text{OR}$$$ of all elements in it is not less than the number of elements in that subarray. Given a positive integer $$$n$$$, output any good permutation of length $$$n$$$. We can show that for the given constraints such a permutation always exists.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first and only line of every test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$).OutputFor every test, output any good permutation of length $$$n$$$ on a separate line.     constructive algorithms      math      *800
