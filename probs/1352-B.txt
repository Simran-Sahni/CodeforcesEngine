B. Same Parity Summandstime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given two positive integers $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^9$$$) and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le 100$$$). Represent the number $$$n$$$ as the sum of $$$k$$$ positive integers of the same parity (have the same remainder when divided by $$$2$$$).In other words, find $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$$$ such that all $$$a_i>0$$$, $$$n = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_k$$$ and either all $$$a_i$$$ are even or all $$$a_i$$$ are odd at the same time.If such a representation does not exist, then report it.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) â€” the number of test cases in the input. Next, $$$t$$$ test cases are given, one per line.Each test case is two positive integers $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^9$$$) and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le 100$$$).OutputFor each test case print:  YES and the required values $$$a_i$$$, if the answer exists (if there are several answers, print any of them);  NO if the answer does not exist. The letters in the words YES and NO can be printed in any case     constructive algorithms      math      *1200
