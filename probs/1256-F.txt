F. Equalizing Two Stringstime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ both of length $$$n$$$ and both consisting of lowercase Latin letters.In one move, you can choose any length $$$len$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and perform the following operation:   Choose any contiguous substring of the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$len$$$ and reverse it;  at the same time choose any contiguous substring of the string $$$t$$$ of length $$$len$$$ and reverse it as well. Note that during one move you reverse exactly one substring of the string $$$s$$$ and exactly one substring of the string $$$t$$$.Also note that borders of substrings you reverse in $$$s$$$ and in $$$t$$$ can be different, the only restriction is that you reverse the substrings of equal length. For example, if $$$len=3$$$ and $$$n=5$$$, you can reverse $$$s[1 \dots 3]$$$ and $$$t[3 \dots 5]$$$, $$$s[2 \dots 4]$$$ and $$$t[2 \dots 4]$$$, but not $$$s[1 \dots 3]$$$ and $$$t[1 \dots 2]$$$.Your task is to say if it is possible to make strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ equal after some (possibly, empty) sequence of moves.You have to answer $$$q$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$q$$$ test cases follow.The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$.The second line of the test case contains one string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters.The third line of the test case contains one string $$$t$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer on it — "YES" (without quotes) if it is possible to make strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ equal after some (possibly, empty) sequence of moves and "NO" otherwise     constructive algorithms      sortings      strings      *2000
