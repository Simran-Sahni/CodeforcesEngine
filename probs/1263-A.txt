A. Sweet Problemtime 1 secondmemory 256 You have three piles of candies: red, green and blue candies:  the first pile contains only red candies and there are $$$r$$$ candies in it,  the second pile contains only green candies and there are $$$g$$$ candies in it,  the third pile contains only blue candies and there are $$$b$$$ candies in it. Each day Tanya eats exactly two candies of different colors. She is free to choose the colors of eaten candies: the only restriction that she can't eat two candies of the same color in a day.Find the maximal number of days Tanya can eat candies? Each day she needs to eat exactly two candies.InputThe first line contains integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases in the input. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case is given as a separate line of the input. It contains three integers $$$r$$$, $$$g$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \le r, g, b \le 10^8$$$) — the number of red, green and blue candies, respectively.OutputPrint $$$t$$$ integers: the $$$i$$$-th printed integer is the answer on the $$$i$$$-th test case in the input     math      *1100
