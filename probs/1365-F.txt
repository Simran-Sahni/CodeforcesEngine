F. Swaps Againtime 2  256 Ayush, Ashish and Vivek are busy preparing a new problem for the next Codeforces round and need help checking if their test cases are valid.Each test case consists of an integer $$$n$$$ and two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, of size $$$n$$$. If after some (possibly zero) operations described below, array $$$a$$$ can be transformed into array $$$b$$$, the input is said to be valid. Otherwise, it is invalid.An operation on array $$$a$$$ is:   select an integer $$$k$$$ $$$(1 \le k \le \lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor)$$$  swap the prefix of length $$$k$$$ with the suffix of length $$$k$$$ For example, if array $$$a$$$ initially is $$$\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$$$, after performing an operation with $$$k = 2$$$, it is transformed into $$$\{5, 6, 3, 4, 1, 2\}$$$.Given the set of test cases, help them determine if each one is valid or invalid.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \le t \le 500)$$$ — the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \le n \le 500)$$$ — the size of the arrays.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ $$$(1 \le a_i \le 10^9)$$$ — elements of array $$$a$$$.The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1$$$, $$$b_2$$$, ..., $$$b_n$$$ $$$(1 \le b_i \le 10^9)$$$ — elements of array $$$b$$$.OutputFor each test case, print "Yes" if the given input is valid. Otherwise print "No".You may print the answer in any case     constructive algorithms      implementation      sortings      *2100
