D. Make Them Equaltime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. You can perform the following operation no more than $$$3n$$$ times:  choose three integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le i, j \le n$$$; $$$0 \le x \le 10^9$$$);  assign $$$a_i := a_i - x \cdot i$$$, $$$a_j := a_j + x \cdot i$$$. After each operation, all elements of the array should be non-negative.Can you find a sequence of no more than $$$3n$$$ operations after which all elements of the array are equal?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^4$$$) — the number of elements in the array. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^5$$$) — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.OutputFor each test case print the answer to it as follows:  if there is no suitable sequence of operations, print $$$-1$$$;  otherwise, print one integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \le k \le 3n$$$) — the number of operations in the sequence. Then print $$$k$$$ lines, the $$$m$$$-th of which should contain three integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le i, j \le n$$$; $$$0 \le x \le 10^9$$$) for the $$$m$$$-th operation. If there are multiple suitable sequences of operations, print any of them. Note that you don't have to minimize $$$k$$$     constructive algorithms      greedy      math      *2000
