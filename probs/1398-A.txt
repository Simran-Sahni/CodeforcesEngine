A. Bad Triangletime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n$$$, which is sorted in non-decreasing order ($$$a_i \le a_{i + 1})$$$. Find three indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$ such that $$$1 \le i < j < k \le n$$$ and it is impossible to construct a non-degenerate triangle (a triangle with nonzero area) having sides equal to $$$a_i$$$, $$$a_j$$$ and $$$a_k$$$ (for example it is possible to construct a non-degenerate triangle with sides $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ but impossible with sides $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$7$$$). If it is impossible to find such triple, report it.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$; $$$a_{i - 1} \le a_i$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print the answer to it in one line.If there is a triple of indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$i < j < k$$$) such that it is impossible to construct a non-degenerate triangle having sides equal to $$$a_i$$$, $$$a_j$$$ and $$$a_k$$$, print that three indices in ascending order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.Otherwise, print -1     geometry      math      *800
