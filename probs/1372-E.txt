E. Omkar and Last Floortime 2  256 Omkar is building a house. He wants to decide how to make the floor plan for the last floor.Omkar's floor starts out as $$$n$$$ rows of $$$m$$$ zeros ($$$1 \le n,m \le 100$$$). Every row is divided into intervals such that every $$$0$$$ in the row is in exactly $$$1$$$ interval. For every interval for every row, Omkar can change exactly one of the $$$0$$$s contained in that interval to a $$$1$$$. Omkar defines the quality of a floor as the sum of the squares of the sums of the values in each column, i. e. if the sum of the values in the $$$i$$$-th column is $$$q_i$$$, then the quality of the floor is $$$\sum_{i = 1}^m q_i^2$$$.Help Omkar find the maximum quality that the floor can have.InputThe first line contains two integers, $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n,m \le 100$$$), which are the number of rows and number of columns, respectively.You will then receive a description of the intervals in each row. For every row $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$: The first row contains a single integer $$$k_i$$$ ($$$1 \le k_i \le m$$$), which is the number of intervals on row $$$i$$$. The $$$j$$$-th of the next $$$k_i$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_{i,j}$$$ and $$$r_{i,j}$$$, which are the left and right bound (both inclusive), respectively, of the $$$j$$$-th interval of the $$$i$$$-th row. It is guaranteed that all intervals other than the first interval will be directly after the interval before it. Formally, $$$l_{i,1} = 1$$$, $$$l_{i,j} \leq r_{i,j}$$$ for all $$$1 \le j \le k_i$$$, $$$r_{i,j-1} + 1 = l_{i,j}$$$ for all $$$2 \le j \le k_i$$$, and $$$r_{i,k_i} = m$$$.OutputOutput one integer, which is the maximum possible quality of an eligible floor plan     dp      greedy      two pointers      *2900
