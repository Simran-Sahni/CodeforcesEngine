D. Discrete Centrifugal Jumpstime 2  256 There are $$$n$$$ beautiful skyscrapers in New York, the height of the $$$i$$$-th one is $$$h_i$$$. Today some villains have set on fire first $$$n - 1$$$ of them, and now the only safety building is $$$n$$$-th skyscraper.Let's call a jump from $$$i$$$-th skyscraper to $$$j$$$-th ($$$i < j$$$) discrete, if all skyscrapers between are strictly lower or higher than both of them. Formally, jump is discrete, if $$$i < j$$$ and one of the following conditions satisfied:   $$$i + 1 = j$$$  $$$\max(h_{i + 1}, \ldots, h_{j - 1}) < \min(h_i, h_j)$$$  $$$\max(h_i, h_j) < \min(h_{i + 1}, \ldots, h_{j - 1})$$$. At the moment, Vasya is staying on the first skyscraper and wants to live a little longer, so his goal is to reach $$$n$$$-th skyscraper with minimal count of discrete jumps. Help him with calcualting this number.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — total amount of skyscrapers.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_n$$$ ($$$1 \le h_i \le 10^9$$$) — heights of skyscrapers.OutputPrint single number $$$k$$$ — minimal amount of discrete jumps. We can show that an answer always exists.     data structures      dp      graphs      *2200
