E. Boboniu and Banknote Collectiontime 1 secondmemory 256 No matter what trouble you're in, don't be afraid, but face it with a smile.I've made another billion dollars! — BoboniuBoboniu has issued his currencies, named Bobo Yuan. Bobo Yuan (BBY) is a series of currencies. Boboniu gives each of them a positive integer identifier, such as BBY-1, BBY-2, etc.Boboniu has a BBY collection. His collection looks like a sequence. For example:  We can use sequence $$$a=[1,2,3,3,2,1,4,4,1]$$$ of length $$$n=9$$$ to denote it.Now Boboniu wants to fold his collection. You can imagine that Boboniu stick his collection to a long piece of paper and fold it between currencies:  Boboniu will only fold the same identifier of currencies together. In other words, if $$$a_i$$$ is folded over $$$a_j$$$ ($$$1\le i,j\le n$$$), then $$$a_i=a_j$$$ must hold. Boboniu doesn't care if you follow this rule in the process of folding. But once it is finished, the rule should be obeyed.A formal definition of fold is described in notes.According to the picture above, you can fold $$$a$$$ two times. In fact, you can fold $$$a=[1,2,3,3,2,1,4,4,1]$$$ at most two times. So the maximum number of folds of it is $$$2$$$.As an international fan of Boboniu, you're asked to calculate the maximum number of folds. You're given a sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1\le i\le n$$$), you need to calculate the maximum number of folds of $$$[a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_i]$$$.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\le a_i\le n$$$).OutputPrint $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th of them should be equal to the maximum number of folds of $$$[a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_i]$$$.     strings      *3500
