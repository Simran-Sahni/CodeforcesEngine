C. Even Picturetime 2  512 Leo Jr. draws pictures in his notebook with checkered sheets (that is, each sheet has a regular square grid printed on it). We can assume that the sheets are infinitely large in any direction.To draw a picture, Leo Jr. colors some of the cells on a sheet gray. He considers the resulting picture beautiful if the following conditions are satisfied: The picture is connected, that is, it is possible to get from any gray cell to any other by following a chain of gray cells, with each pair of adjacent cells in the path being neighbours (that is, sharing a side). Each gray cell has an even number of gray neighbours. There are exactly $$$n$$$ gray cells with all gray neighbours. The number of other gray cells can be arbitrary (but reasonable, so that they can all be listed).Leo Jr. is now struggling to draw a beautiful picture with a particular choice of $$$n$$$. Help him, and provide any example of a beautiful picture.To output cell coordinates in your answer, assume that the sheet is provided with a Cartesian coordinate system such that one of the cells is chosen to be the origin $$$(0, 0)$$$, axes $$$0x$$$ and $$$0y$$$ are orthogonal and parallel to grid lines, and a unit step along any axis in any direction takes you to a neighbouring cell.InputThe only line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 500$$$) — the number of gray cells with all gray neighbours in a beautiful picture.OutputIn the first line, print a single integer $$$k$$$ — the number of gray cells in your picture. For technical reasons, $$$k$$$ should not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^5$$$.Each of the following $$$k$$$ lines should contain two integers — coordinates of a gray cell in your picture. All listed cells should be distinct, and the picture should satisdfy all the properties listed above. All coordinates should not exceed $$$10^9$$$ by absolute value.One can show that there exists an answer satisfying all requirements with a small enough $$$k$$$     constructive algorithms      *1500
