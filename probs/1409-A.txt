A. Yet Another Two Integers Problemtime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.In one move, you can choose some integer $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$10$$$ and add it to $$$a$$$ or subtract it from $$$a$$$. In other words, you choose an integer $$$k \in [1; 10]$$$ and perform $$$a := a + k$$$ or $$$a := a - k$$$. You may use different values of $$$k$$$ in different moves.Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain $$$b$$$ from $$$a$$$.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The only line of the test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b \le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of moves required to obtain $$$b$$$ from $$$a$$$     greedy      math      *800
