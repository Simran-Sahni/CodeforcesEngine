A3. Distinguish Z from Stime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given an operation that implements a single-qubit unitary transformation: either the Z gate or the S gate. The operation will have Adjoint and Controlled variants defined.Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which unitary it was and to return 0 if it was the Z gate or 1 if it was the S gate. You are allowed to apply the given operation and its adjoint/controlled variants exactly twice.You have to implement an operation which takes a single-qubit operation as an input and returns an integer. Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;    operation Solve (unitary : (Qubit => Unit is Adj+Ctl)) : Int {        // your code here    }     *special problem
