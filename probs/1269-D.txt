D. Domino for Youngtime 3  256 You are given a Young diagram. Given diagram is a histogram with $$$n$$$ columns of lengths $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \ldots \geq a_n \geq 1$$$).  Young diagram for $$$a=[3,2,2,2,1]$$$. Your goal is to find the largest number of non-overlapping dominos that you can draw inside of this histogram, a domino is a $$$1 \times 2$$$ or $$$2 \times 1$$$ rectangle.InputThe first line of input contain one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 300\,000$$$): the number of columns in the given histogram.The next line of input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 300\,000, a_i \geq a_{i+1}$$$): the lengths of columns.OutputOutput one integer: the largest number of non-overlapping dominos that you can draw inside of the given Young diagram     combinatorics      constructive algorithms      math      *2000
