B. Food Buyingtime 1 secondmemory 256 Mishka wants to buy some food in the nearby shop. Initially, he has $$$s$$$ burles on his card. Mishka can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose some positive integer number $$$1 \le x \le s$$$, buy food that costs exactly $$$x$$$ burles and obtain $$$\lfloor\frac{x}{10}\rfloor$$$ burles as a cashback (in other words, Mishka spends $$$x$$$ burles and obtains $$$\lfloor\frac{x}{10}\rfloor$$$ back). The operation $$$\lfloor\frac{a}{b}\rfloor$$$ means $$$a$$$ divided by $$$b$$$ rounded down.It is guaranteed that you can always buy some food that costs $$$x$$$ for any possible value of $$$x$$$.Your task is to say the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.For example, if Mishka has $$$s=19$$$ burles then the maximum number of burles he can spend is $$$21$$$. Firstly, he can spend $$$x=10$$$ burles, obtain $$$1$$$ burle as a cashback. Now he has $$$s=10$$$ burles, so can spend $$$x=10$$$ burles, obtain $$$1$$$ burle as a cashback and spend it too.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The next $$$t$$$ lines describe test cases. Each test case is given on a separate line and consists of one integer $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le s \le 10^9$$$) — the number of burles Mishka initially has.OutputFor each test case print the answer on it — the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally     math      *900
