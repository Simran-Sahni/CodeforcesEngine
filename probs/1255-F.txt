F. Point Orderingtime 1 secondmemory 256 This is an interactive problem.Khanh has $$$n$$$ points on the Cartesian plane, denoted by $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. All points' coordinates are integers between $$$-10^9$$$ and $$$10^9$$$, inclusive. No three points are collinear. He says that these points are vertices of a convex polygon; in other words, there exists a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ such that the polygon $$$a_{p_1} a_{p_2} \ldots a_{p_n}$$$ is convex and vertices are listed in counter-clockwise order.Khanh gives you the number $$$n$$$, but hides the coordinates of his points. Your task is to guess the above permutation by asking multiple queries. In each query, you give Khanh $$$4$$$ integers $$$t$$$, $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$; where either $$$t = 1$$$ or $$$t = 2$$$; and $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$ are three distinct indices from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, inclusive. In response, Khanh tells you:  if $$$t = 1$$$, the area of the triangle $$$a_ia_ja_k$$$ multiplied by $$$2$$$.  if $$$t = 2$$$, the sign of the cross product of two vectors $$$\overrightarrow{a_ia_j}$$$ and $$$\overrightarrow{a_ia_k}$$$. Recall that the cross product of vector $$$\overrightarrow{a} = (x_a, y_a)$$$ and vector $$$\overrightarrow{b} = (x_b, y_b)$$$ is the integer $$$x_a \cdot y_b - x_b \cdot y_a$$$. The sign of a number is $$$1$$$ it it is positive, and $$$-1$$$ otherwise. It can be proven that the cross product obtained in the above queries can not be $$$0$$$.You can ask at most $$$3 \cdot n$$$ queries.Please note that Khanh fixes the coordinates of his points and does not change it while answering your queries. You do not need to guess the coordinates. In your permutation $$$a_{p_1}a_{p_2}\ldots a_{p_n}$$$, $$$p_1$$$ should be equal to $$$1$$$ and the indices of vertices should be listed in counter-clockwise order.InteractionYou start the interaction by reading $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \leq n \leq 1\,000$$$) — the number of vertices.To ask a query, write $$$4$$$ integers $$$t$$$, $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 2$$$, $$$1 \leq i, j, k \leq n$$$) in a separate line. $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ and $$$k$$$ should be distinct.Then read a single integer to get the answer to this query, as explained above. It can be proven that the answer of a query is always an integer.When you find the permutation, write a number $$$0$$$. Then write $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ in the same line.After printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use: fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; System.out.flush() in Java; flush(output) in Pascal; stdout.flush() in Python; see documentation for other languages.Hack formatTo hack, use the following format:The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \leq n \leq 1\,000$$$) — the number of vertices.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le x_i, y_i \le 10^9$$$) — the coordinate of the point $$$a_i$$$     geometry      interactive      *2300
