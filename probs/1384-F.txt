F. Rearrangetime 1 secondmemory 256 Koa the Koala has a matrix $$$A$$$ of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. Elements of this matrix are distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n \cdot m$$$ (each number from $$$1$$$ to $$$n \cdot m$$$ appears exactly once in the matrix).For any matrix $$$M$$$ of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns let's define the following:  The $$$i$$$-th row of $$$M$$$ is defined as $$$R_i(M) = [ M_{i1}, M_{i2}, \ldots, M_{im} ]$$$ for all $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$).  The $$$j$$$-th column of $$$M$$$ is defined as $$$C_j(M) = [ M_{1j}, M_{2j}, \ldots, M_{nj} ]$$$ for all $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le j \le m$$$). Koa defines $$$S(A) = (X, Y)$$$ as the spectrum of $$$A$$$, where $$$X$$$ is the set of the maximum values in rows of $$$A$$$ and $$$Y$$$ is the set of the maximum values in columns of $$$A$$$.More formally:  $$$X = \{ \max(R_1(A)), \max(R_2(A)), \ldots, \max(R_n(A)) \}$$$  $$$Y = \{ \max(C_1(A)), \max(C_2(A)), \ldots, \max(C_m(A)) \}$$$Koa asks you to find some matrix $$$A'$$$ of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, such that each number from $$$1$$$ to $$$n \cdot m$$$ appears exactly once in the matrix, and the following conditions hold:  $$$S(A') = S(A)$$$  $$$R_i(A')$$$ is bitonic for all $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$)  $$$C_j(A')$$$ is bitonic for all $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le j \le m$$$)  An array $$$t$$$ ($$$t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k$$$) is called bitonic if it first increases and then decreases. More formally: $$$t$$$ is bitonic if there exists some position $$$p$$$ ($$$1 \le p \le k$$$) such that: $$$t_1 < t_2 < \ldots < t_p > t_{p+1} > \ldots > t_k$$$.Help Koa to find such matrix or to determine that it doesn't exist.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 250$$$)  — the number of rows and columns of $$$A$$$.Each of the ollowing $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers. The $$$j$$$-th integer in the $$$i$$$-th line denotes element $$$A_{ij}$$$ ($$$1 \le A_{ij} \le n \cdot m$$$) of matrix $$$A$$$. It is guaranteed that every number from $$$1$$$ to $$$n \cdot m$$$ appears exactly once among elements of the matrix.OutputIf such matrix doesn't exist, print $$$-1$$$ on a single line.Otherwise, the output must consist of $$$n$$$ lines, each one consisting of $$$m$$$ space separated integers  — a description of $$$A'$$$.The $$$j$$$-th number in the $$$i$$$-th line represents the element $$$A'_{ij}$$$.Every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n \cdot m$$$ should appear exactly once in $$$A'$$$, every row and column in $$$A'$$$ must be bitonic and $$$S(A) = S(A')$$$ must hold.If there are many answers print any.     constructive algorithms      greedy      *2800
