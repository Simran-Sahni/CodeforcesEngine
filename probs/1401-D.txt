D. Maximum Distributed Treetime 2  256 You are given a tree that consists of $$$n$$$ nodes. You should label each of its $$$n-1$$$ edges with an integer in such way that satisfies the following conditions:   each integer must be greater than $$$0$$$;  the product of all $$$n-1$$$ numbers should be equal to $$$k$$$;  the number of $$$1$$$-s among all $$$n-1$$$ integers must be minimum possible. Let's define $$$f(u,v)$$$ as the sum of the numbers on the simple path from node $$$u$$$ to node $$$v$$$. Also, let $$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum\limits_{j=i+1}^n f(i,j)$$$ be a distribution index of the tree.Find the maximum possible distribution index you can get. Since answer can be too large, print it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.In this problem, since the number $$$k$$$ can be large, the result of the prime factorization of $$$k$$$ is given instead.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the number of nodes in the tree.Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines describes an edge: the $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$$$; $$$u_i \ne v_i$$$) — indices of vertices connected by the $$$i$$$-th edge.Next line contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le m \le 6 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of prime factors of $$$k$$$.Next line contains $$$m$$$ prime numbers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$$$ ($$$2 \le p_i < 6 \cdot 10^4$$$) such that $$$k = p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_m$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$, the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$6 \cdot 10^4$$$, and the given edges for each test cases form a tree.OutputPrint the maximum distribution index you can get.
