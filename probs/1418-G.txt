G. Three Occurrencestime 5  512 You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. We denote the subarray $$$a[l..r]$$$ as the array $$$[a_l, a_{l + 1}, \dots, a_r]$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$).A subarray is considered good if every integer that occurs in this subarray occurs there exactly thrice. For example, the array $$$[1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]$$$ has three good subarrays:  $$$a[1..6] = [1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1]$$$;  $$$a[2..4] = [2, 2, 2]$$$;  $$$a[7..9] = [2, 2, 2]$$$. Calculate the number of good subarrays of the given array $$$a$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$).OutputPrint one integer â€” the number of good subarrays of the array $$$a$$$.     data structures      divide and conquer      hashing      two pointers      *2500
