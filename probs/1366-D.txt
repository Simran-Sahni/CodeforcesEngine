D. Two Divisorstime 2  256 You are given $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$.For each $$$a_i$$$ find its two divisors $$$d_1 > 1$$$ and $$$d_2 > 1$$$ such that $$$\gcd(d_1 + d_2, a_i) = 1$$$ (where $$$\gcd(a, b)$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$) or say that there is no such pair.InputThe first line contains single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$2 \le a_i \le 10^7$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.OutputTo speed up the output, print two lines with $$$n$$$ integers in each line.The $$$i$$$-th integers in the first and second lines should be corresponding divisors $$$d_1 > 1$$$ and $$$d_2 > 1$$$ such that $$$\gcd(d_1 + d_2, a_i) = 1$$$ or $$$-1$$$ and $$$-1$$$ if there is no such pair.
