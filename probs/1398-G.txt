G. Running Competitiontime 2  512 A running competition is going to be held soon. The stadium where the competition will be held can be represented by several segments on the coordinate plane:  two horizontal segments: one connecting the points $$$(0, 0)$$$ and $$$(x, 0)$$$, the other connecting the points $$$(0, y)$$$ and $$$(x, y)$$$;  $$$n + 1$$$ vertical segments, numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th segment connects the points $$$(a_i, 0)$$$ and $$$(a_i, y)$$$; $$$0 = a_0 < a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_{n - 1} < a_n = x$$$. For example, here is a picture of the stadium with $$$x = 10$$$, $$$y = 5$$$, $$$n = 3$$$ and $$$a = [0, 3, 5, 10]$$$:  A lap is a route that goes along the segments, starts and finishes at the same point, and never intersects itself (the only two points of a lap that coincide are its starting point and ending point). The length of a lap is a total distance travelled around it. For example, the red route in the picture representing the stadium is a lap of length $$$24$$$.The competition will be held in $$$q$$$ stages. The $$$i$$$-th stage has length $$$l_i$$$, and the organizers want to choose a lap for each stage such that the length of the lap is a divisor of $$$l_i$$$. The organizers don't want to choose short laps for the stages, so for each stage, they want to find the maximum possible length of a suitable lap.Help the organizers to calculate the maximum possible lengths of the laps for the stages! In other words, for every $$$l_i$$$, find the maximum possible integer $$$L$$$ such that $$$l_i \bmod L = 0$$$, and there exists a lap of length exactly $$$L$$$.If it is impossible to choose such a lap then print $$$-1$$$.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \le n, x, y \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$n \le x$$$).The second line contains $$$n + 1$$$ integers $$$a_0$$$, $$$a_1$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$0 = a_0 < a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_{n - 1} < a_n = x$$$).The third line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of stages.The fourth line contains $$$q$$$ even integers $$$l_1$$$, $$$l_2$$$, ..., $$$l_q$$$ ($$$4 \le l_i \le 10^6$$$) — the lengths of the stages. OutputPrint $$$q$$$ numbers. The $$$i$$$-th number should be equal to the maximum possible length of a suitable lap for the $$$i$$$-th stage, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible to choose a lap for that stage     bitmasks      fft      math      number theory      *2600
