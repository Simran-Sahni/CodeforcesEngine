E. Obtain a Permutationtime 2  256 You are given a rectangular matrix of size $$$n \times m$$$ consisting of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.In one move, you can:  choose any element of the matrix and change its value to any integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$n \cdot m$$$, inclusive;  take any column and shift it one cell up cyclically (see the example of such cyclic shift below). A cyclic shift is an operation such that you choose some $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le j \le m$$$) and set $$$a_{1, j} := a_{2, j}, a_{2, j} := a_{3, j}, \dots, a_{n, j} := a_{1, j}$$$ simultaneously.  Example of cyclic shift of the first column You want to perform the minimum number of moves to make this matrix look like this:  In other words, the goal is to obtain the matrix, where $$$a_{1, 1} = 1, a_{1, 2} = 2, \dots, a_{1, m} = m, a_{2, 1} = m + 1, a_{2, 2} = m + 2, \dots, a_{n, m} = n \cdot m$$$ (i.e. $$$a_{i, j} = (i - 1) \cdot m + j$$$) with the minimum number of moves performed.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5, n \cdot m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the matrix.The next $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$m$$$ integers each. The number at the line $$$i$$$ and position $$$j$$$ is $$$a_{i, j}$$$ ($$$1 \le a_{i, j} \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).OutputPrint one integer — the minimum number of moves required to obtain the matrix, where $$$a_{1, 1} = 1, a_{1, 2} = 2, \dots, a_{1, m} = m, a_{2, 1} = m + 1, a_{2, 2} = m + 2, \dots, a_{n, m} = n \cdot m$$$ ($$$a_{i, j} = (i - 1)m + j$$$).     greedy      implementation      math      *1900
