C. Good Stringtime 2  256 Let's call left cyclic shift of some string $$$t_1 t_2 t_3 \dots t_{n - 1} t_n$$$ as string $$$t_2 t_3 \dots t_{n - 1} t_n t_1$$$.Analogically, let's call right cyclic shift of string $$$t$$$ as string $$$t_n t_1 t_2 t_3 \dots t_{n - 1}$$$.Let's say string $$$t$$$ is good if its left cyclic shift is equal to its right cyclic shift.You are given string $$$s$$$ which consists of digits 0–9.What is the minimum number of characters you need to erase from $$$s$$$ to make it good?InputThe first line contains single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.Next $$$t$$$ lines contains test cases — one per line. The first and only line of each test case contains string $$$s$$$ ($$$2 \le |s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$). Each character $$$s_i$$$ is digit 0–9.It's guaranteed that the total length of strings doesn't exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the minimum number of characters you need to erase from $$$s$$$ to make it good     brute force      dp      greedy      two pointers      *1500
