A. Maximum GCDtime 1 secondmemory 256 Let's consider all integers in the range from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (inclusive).Among all pairs of distinct integers in this range, find the maximum possible greatest common divisor of integers in pair. Formally, find the maximum value of $$$\mathrm{gcd}(a, b)$$$, where $$$1 \leq a < b \leq n$$$.The greatest common divisor, $$$\mathrm{gcd}(a, b)$$$, of two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ is the biggest integer that is a divisor of both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 10^6$$$).OutputFor each test case, output the maximum value of $$$\mathrm{gcd}(a, b)$$$ among all $$$1 \leq a < b \leq n$$$     greedy      implementation      math      number theory      *800
