D. 505time 1 secondmemory 256 A binary matrix is called good if every even length square sub-matrix has an odd number of ones. Given a binary matrix $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, determine the minimum number of cells you need to change to make it good, or report that there is no way to make it good at all. All the terms above have their usual meanings — refer to the Notes section for their formal definitions. InputThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq m \leq 10^6$$$ and $$$n\cdot m \leq 10^6$$$)  — the number of rows and columns in $$$a$$$, respectively. The following $$$n$$$ lines each contain $$$m$$$ characters, each of which is one of 0 and 1. If the $$$j$$$-th character on the $$$i$$$-th line is 1, then $$$a_{i,j} = 1$$$. Similarly, if the $$$j$$$-th character on the $$$i$$$-th line is 0, then $$$a_{i,j} = 0$$$.OutputOutput the minimum number of cells you need to change to make $$$a$$$ good, or output $$$-1$$$ if it's not possible at all.     bitmasks      brute force      constructive algorithms      dp      greedy      implementation      *2000
