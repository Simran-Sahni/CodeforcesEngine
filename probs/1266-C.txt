C. Diverse Matrixtime 1 secondmemory 256 Let $$$a$$$ be a matrix of size $$$r \times c$$$ containing positive integers, not necessarily distinct. Rows of the matrix are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$r$$$, columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$c$$$. We can construct an array $$$b$$$ consisting of $$$r + c$$$ integers as follows: for each $$$i \in [1, r]$$$, let $$$b_i$$$ be the greatest common divisor of integers in the $$$i$$$-th row, and for each $$$j \in [1, c]$$$ let $$$b_{r+j}$$$ be the greatest common divisor of integers in the $$$j$$$-th column. We call the matrix diverse if all $$$r + c$$$ numbers $$$b_k$$$ ($$$k \in [1, r + c]$$$) are pairwise distinct. The magnitude of a matrix equals to the maximum of $$$b_k$$$.For example, suppose we have the following matrix: $$$\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 9 & 7\\ 4 & 144 & 84 \end{pmatrix}$$$ We construct the array $$$b$$$:  $$$b_1$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$2$$$, $$$9$$$, and $$$7$$$, that is $$$1$$$;  $$$b_2$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$4$$$, $$$144$$$, and $$$84$$$, that is $$$4$$$;  $$$b_3$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$, that is $$$2$$$;  $$$b_4$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$9$$$ and $$$144$$$, that is $$$9$$$;  $$$b_5$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$7$$$ and $$$84$$$, that is $$$7$$$. So $$$b = [1, 4, 2, 9, 7]$$$. All values in this array are distinct, so the matrix is diverse. The magnitude is equal to $$$9$$$.For a given $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$, find a diverse matrix that minimises the magnitude. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them. If there are no solutions, output a single integer $$$0$$$. InputThe only line in the input contains two space separated integers $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \leq r,c \leq 500$$$) — the number of rows and the number of columns of the matrix to be found.OutputIf there is no solution, output a single integer $$$0$$$.Otherwise, output $$$r$$$ rows. The $$$i$$$-th of them should contain $$$c$$$ space-separated integers, the $$$j$$$-th of which is $$$a_{i,j}$$$ — the positive integer in the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column of a diverse matrix minimizing the magnitude.Furthermore, it must hold that $$$1 \leq a_{i,j} \leq 10^9$$$. It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is also a solution with this additional constraint (still having minimum possible magnitude).     constructive algorithms      greedy      math      number theory      *1400
