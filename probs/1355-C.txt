C. Count Trianglestime 1 secondmemory 256 Like any unknown mathematician, Yuri has favourite numbers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$, and $$$D$$$, where $$$A \leq B \leq C \leq D$$$. Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \leq x \leq B \leq y \leq C \leq z \leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.InputThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \leq A \leq B \leq C \leq D \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.OutputPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \leq x \leq B \leq y \leq C \leq z \leq D$$$ holds.     binary search      implementation      math      two pointers      *1800
