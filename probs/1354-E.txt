E. Graph Coloringtime 2  256 You are given an undirected graph without self-loops or multiple edges which consists of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges. Also you are given three integers $$$n_1$$$, $$$n_2$$$ and $$$n_3$$$.Can you label each vertex with one of three numbers 1, 2 or 3 in such way, that:   Each vertex should be labeled by exactly one number 1, 2 or 3;  The total number of vertices with label 1 should be equal to $$$n_1$$$;  The total number of vertices with label 2 should be equal to $$$n_2$$$;  The total number of vertices with label 3 should be equal to $$$n_3$$$;  $$$|col_u - col_v| = 1$$$ for each edge $$$(u, v)$$$, where $$$col_x$$$ is the label of vertex $$$x$$$. If there are multiple valid labelings, print any of them.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5000$$$; $$$0 \le m \le 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph.The second line contains three integers $$$n_1$$$, $$$n_2$$$ and $$$n_3$$$ ($$$0 \le n_1, n_2, n_3 \le n$$$) — the number of labels 1, 2 and 3, respectively. It's guaranteed that $$$n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = n$$$.Next $$$m$$$ lines contan description of edges: the $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$$$; $$$u_i \neq v_i$$$) — the vertices the $$$i$$$-th edge connects. It's guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain self-loops or multiple edges.OutputIf valid labeling exists then print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print string of length $$$n$$$ consisting of 1, 2 and 3. The $$$i$$$-th letter should be equal to the label of the $$$i$$$-th vertex.If there is no valid labeling, print "NO" (without quotes).     dfs and similar      dp      graphs      *2100
