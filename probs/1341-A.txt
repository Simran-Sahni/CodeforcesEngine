A. Nastya and Ricetime 1 secondmemory 256 Nastya just made a huge mistake and dropped a whole package of rice on the floor. Mom will come soon. If she sees this, then Nastya will be punished.In total, Nastya dropped $$$n$$$ grains. Nastya read that each grain weighs some integer number of grams from $$$a - b$$$ to $$$a + b$$$, inclusive (numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are known), and the whole package of $$$n$$$ grains weighs from $$$c - d$$$ to $$$c + d$$$ grams, inclusive (numbers $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$ are known). The weight of the package is the sum of the weights of all $$$n$$$ grains in it.Help Nastya understand if this information can be correct. In other words, check whether each grain can have such a mass that the $$$i$$$-th grain weighs some integer number $$$x_i$$$ $$$(a - b \leq x_i \leq a + b)$$$, and in total they weigh from $$$c - d$$$ to $$$c + d$$$, inclusive ($$$c - d \leq \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{x_i} \leq c + d$$$).InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \leq t \leq 1000)$$$  — the number of test cases. The next $$$t$$$ lines contain descriptions of the test cases, each line contains $$$5$$$ integers: $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \leq n \leq 1000)$$$  — the number of grains that Nastya counted and $$$a, b, c, d$$$ $$$(0 \leq b < a \leq 1000, 0 \leq d < c \leq 1000)$$$  — numbers that determine the possible weight of one grain of rice (from $$$a - b$$$ to $$$a + b$$$) and the possible total weight of the package (from $$$c - d$$$ to $$$c + d$$$).OutputFor each test case given in the input print "Yes", if the information about the weights is not inconsistent, and print "No" if $$$n$$$ grains with masses from $$$a - b$$$ to $$$a + b$$$ cannot make a package with a total mass from $$$c - d$$$ to $$$c + d$$$     math      *900
