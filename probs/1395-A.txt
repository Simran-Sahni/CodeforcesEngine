A. Boboniu Likes to Color Ballstime 1 secondmemory 256 Boboniu gives you  $$$r$$$ red balls,  $$$g$$$ green balls,  $$$b$$$ blue balls,  $$$w$$$ white balls. He allows you to do the following operation as many times as you want:   Pick a red ball, a green ball, and a blue ball and then change their color to white. You should answer if it's possible to arrange all the balls into a palindrome after several (possibly zero) number of described operations. InputThe first line contains one integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1\le T\le 100$$$) denoting the number of test cases.For each of the next $$$T$$$ cases, the first line contains four integers $$$r$$$, $$$g$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$w$$$ ($$$0\le r,g,b,w\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print "Yes" if it's possible to arrange all the balls into a palindrome after doing several (possibly zero) number of described operations. Otherwise, print "No"     brute force      math      *1000
