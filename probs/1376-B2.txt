B2. Maximal Independent Settime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given an undirected graph $$$G=(V,E)$$$. Your task is to find such a maximal subset of vertices that no two vertices in the subset are connected with an edge from $$$E$$$. You don't need to find the optimal solution: the more the result found, the more points you will receive.The number of scored points is equal to the size of the returned independent set of vertices. You do not need to send the source code of a solution, just provide an independent set of vertices.InputDownload the input data by the link https://assets.codeforces.com/files/6f8518a9aaa619e7/mis.zip.The problem consists of $$$4$$$ subtasks called B1, B2, B3 and B4. They differ only by given graphs. Download the inputs by the link https://assets.codeforces.com/files/6f8518a9aaa619e7/mis.zip.Each input starts with a line containing a pair of integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$: the number of vertices, and the number of edges in the graph. Then $$$m$$$ lines follow. Each of them describes one edge: it contains a pair of integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i, b_i \le n$$$). Given graphs don't contain self-loops (i.e. $$$a_i \ne b_i$$$) and multiple edges (there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices).OutputYou should submit the output, not the source code.The first line of the output should contain $$$k$$$: the size of found independent vertex subset. The second line should contain a separated by spaces sequence of integers $$$x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$$$ ($$$0 \le x_i \le 1$$$), where $$$x_i=1$$$ if the vertex $$$i$$$ belongs to the returned independent set and $$$x_i=0$$$ otherwise.The number of scored points is equal to the size of the returned independent set of vertices     *special problem      graphs
