C. Restoring Permutationtime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given a sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$. Find the lexicographically minimal permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n}$$$ such that $$$b_i = \min(a_{2i-1}, a_{2i})$$$, or determine that it is impossible.InputEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$).The first line of each test case consists of one integer $$$n$$$ — the number of elements in the sequence $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$).The second line of each test case consists of $$$n$$$ different integers $$$b_1, \ldots, b_n$$$ — elements of the sequence $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le 2n$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ by all test cases doesn't exceed $$$100$$$.OutputFor each test case, if there is no appropriate permutation, print one number $$$-1$$$.Otherwise, print $$$2n$$$ integers $$$a_1, \ldots, a_{2n}$$$ — required lexicographically minimal permutation of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$2n$$$     greedy      *1200
