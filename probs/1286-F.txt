F. Harry The Pottertime 9  1024 To defeat Lord Voldemort, Harry needs to destroy all horcruxes first. The last horcrux is an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers, which also needs to be destroyed. The array is considered destroyed if all its elements are zeroes. To destroy the array, Harry can perform two types of operations:  choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$), an integer $$$x$$$, and subtract $$$x$$$ from $$$a_i$$$. choose two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le i, j \le n; i \ne j$$$), an integer $$$x$$$, and subtract $$$x$$$ from $$$a_i$$$ and $$$x + 1$$$ from $$$a_j$$$. Note that $$$x$$$ does not have to be positive.Harry is in a hurry, please help him to find the minimum number of operations required to destroy the array and exterminate Lord Voldemort.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ — the size of the array $$$a$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 20$$$). The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ — array elements ($$$-10^{15} \le a_i \le 10^{15}$$$).OutputOutput a single integer — the minimum number of operations required to destroy the array $$$a$$$.     brute force      constructive algorithms      dp      fft      implementation      math      *3100
