C. Orac and LCMtime 3  256 For the multiset of positive integers $$$s=\{s_1,s_2,\dots,s_k\}$$$, define the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) of $$$s$$$ as follow: $$$\gcd(s)$$$ is the maximum positive integer $$$x$$$, such that all integers in $$$s$$$ are divisible on $$$x$$$. $$$\textrm{lcm}(s)$$$ is the minimum positive integer $$$x$$$, that divisible on all integers from $$$s$$$.For example, $$$\gcd(\{8,12\})=4,\gcd(\{12,18,6\})=6$$$ and $$$\textrm{lcm}(\{4,6\})=12$$$. Note that for any positive integer $$$x$$$, $$$\gcd(\{x\})=\textrm{lcm}(\{x\})=x$$$.Orac has a sequence $$$a$$$ with length $$$n$$$. He come up with the multiset $$$t=\{\textrm{lcm}(\{a_i,a_j\})\ |\ i<j\}$$$, and asked you to find the value of $$$\gcd(t)$$$ for him. In other words, you need to calculate the GCD of LCMs of all pairs of elements in the given sequence.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n\ (2\le n\le 100\,000)$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers, $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 200\,000$$$).OutputPrint one integer: $$$\gcd(\{\textrm{lcm}(\{a_i,a_j\})\ |\ i<j\})$$$.     math      number theory      *1600
