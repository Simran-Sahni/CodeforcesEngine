C. K-th Not Divisible by ntime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. Print the $$$k$$$-th positive integer that is not divisible by $$$n$$$.For example, if $$$n=3$$$, and $$$k=7$$$, then all numbers that are not divisible by $$$3$$$ are: $$$1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13 \dots$$$. The $$$7$$$-th number among them is $$$10$$$.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) â€” the number of test cases in the input. Next, $$$t$$$ test cases are given, one per line.Each test case is two positive integers $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^9$$$) and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case print the $$$k$$$-th positive integer that is not divisible by $$$n$$$     binary search      math      *1200
