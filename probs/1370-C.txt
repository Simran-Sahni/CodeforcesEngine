C. Number Gametime 2  256 Ashishgup and FastestFinger play a game. They start with a number $$$n$$$ and play in turns. In each turn, a player can make any one of the following moves:  Divide $$$n$$$ by any of its odd divisors greater than $$$1$$$.  Subtract $$$1$$$ from $$$n$$$ if $$$n$$$ is greater than $$$1$$$. Divisors of a number include the number itself.The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.Ashishgup moves first. Determine the winner of the game if both of them play optimally.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains a single integer  — $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print "Ashishgup" if he wins, and "FastestFinger" otherwise (without quotes)     games      math      number theory      *1400
