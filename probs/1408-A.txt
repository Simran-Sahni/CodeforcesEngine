A. Circle Coloringtime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given three sequences: $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$; $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$; $$$c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$$$.For each $$$i$$$, $$$a_i \neq b_i$$$, $$$a_i \neq c_i$$$, $$$b_i \neq c_i$$$.Find a sequence $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$, that satisfy the following conditions: $$$p_i \in \{a_i, b_i, c_i\}$$$ $$$p_i \neq p_{(i \mod n) + 1}$$$.In other words, for each element, you need to choose one of the three possible values, such that no two adjacent elements (where we consider elements $$$i,i+1$$$ adjacent for $$$i<n$$$ and also elements $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$) will have equal value.It can be proved that in the given constraints solution always exists. You don't need to minimize/maximize anything, you need to find any proper sequence.InputThe first line of input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$): the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \leq n \leq 100$$$): the number of elements in the given sequences.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 100$$$).The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq b_i \leq 100$$$).The fourth line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq c_i \leq 100$$$).It is guaranteed that $$$a_i \neq b_i$$$, $$$a_i \neq c_i$$$, $$$b_i \neq c_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$.OutputFor each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers: $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$p_i \in \{a_i, b_i, c_i\}$$$, $$$p_i \neq p_{i \mod n + 1}$$$).If there are several solutions, you can print any     constructive algorithms      *800
