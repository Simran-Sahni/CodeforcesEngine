C. Rotation Matchingtime 1 secondmemory 256 After the mysterious disappearance of Ashish, his two favourite disciples Ishika and Hriday, were each left with one half of a secret message. These messages can each be represented by a permutation of size $$$n$$$. Let's call them $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.Note that a permutation of $$$n$$$ elements is a sequence of numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, in which every number from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. The message can be decoded by an arrangement of sequence $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, such that the number of matching pairs of elements between them is maximum. A pair of elements $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_j$$$ is said to match if:   $$$i = j$$$, that is, they are at the same index.  $$$a_i = b_j$$$ His two disciples are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times:   choose a number $$$k$$$ and cyclically shift one of the permutations to the left or right $$$k$$$ times. A single cyclic shift to the left on any permutation $$$c$$$ is an operation that sets $$$c_1:=c_2, c_2:=c_3, \ldots, c_n:=c_1$$$ simultaneously. Likewise, a single cyclic shift to the right on any permutation $$$c$$$ is an operation that sets $$$c_1:=c_n, c_2:=c_1, \ldots, c_n:=c_{n-1}$$$ simultaneously.Help Ishika and Hriday find the maximum number of pairs of elements that match after performing the operation any (possibly zero) number of times.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$$$ — the size of the arrays.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ $$$(1 \le a_i \le n)$$$ — the elements of the first permutation.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1$$$, $$$b_2$$$, ..., $$$b_n$$$ $$$(1 \le b_i \le n)$$$ — the elements of the second permutation.OutputPrint the maximum number of matching pairs of elements after performing the above operations some (possibly zero) times.     constructive algorithms      data structures      greedy      implementation      *1400
