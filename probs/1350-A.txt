A. Orac and Factorstime 2  256 Orac is studying number theory, and he is interested in the properties of divisors.For two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, $$$a$$$ is a divisor of $$$b$$$ if and only if there exists an integer $$$c$$$, such that $$$a\cdot c=b$$$.For $$$n \ge 2$$$, we will denote as $$$f(n)$$$ the smallest positive divisor of $$$n$$$, except $$$1$$$.For example, $$$f(7)=7,f(10)=2,f(35)=5$$$.For the fixed integer $$$n$$$, Orac decided to add $$$f(n)$$$ to $$$n$$$. For example, if he had an integer $$$n=5$$$, the new value of $$$n$$$ will be equal to $$$10$$$. And if he had an integer $$$n=6$$$, $$$n$$$ will be changed to $$$8$$$.Orac loved it so much, so he decided to repeat this operation several times.Now, for two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$, Orac asked you to add $$$f(n)$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly $$$k$$$ times (note that $$$n$$$ will change after each operation, so $$$f(n)$$$ may change too) and tell him the final value of $$$n$$$.For example, if Orac gives you $$$n=5$$$ and $$$k=2$$$, at first you should add $$$f(5)=5$$$ to $$$n=5$$$, so your new value of $$$n$$$ will be equal to $$$n=10$$$, after that, you should add $$$f(10)=2$$$ to $$$10$$$, so your new (and the final!) value of $$$n$$$ will be equal to $$$12$$$.Orac may ask you these queries many times.InputThe first line of the input is a single integer $$$t\ (1\le t\le 100)$$$: the number of times that Orac will ask you.Each of the next $$$t$$$ lines contains two positive integers $$$n,k\ (2\le n\le 10^6, 1\le k\le 10^9)$$$, corresponding to a query by Orac.It is guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ is at most $$$10^6$$$. OutputPrint $$$t$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of them should contain the final value of $$$n$$$ in the $$$i$$$-th query by Orac     math      *900
