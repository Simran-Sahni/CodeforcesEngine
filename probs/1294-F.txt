F. Three Paths on a Treetime 2  256 You are given an unweighted tree with $$$n$$$ vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.Your task is to choose three distinct vertices $$$a, b, c$$$ on this tree such that the number of edges which belong to at least one of the simple paths between $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$, or $$$a$$$ and $$$c$$$ is the maximum possible. See the notes section for a better understanding.The simple path is the path that visits each vertex at most once.InputThe first line contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree. Next $$$n - 1$$$ lines describe the edges of the tree in form $$$a_i, b_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i$$$, $$$b_i \le n$$$, $$$a_i \ne b_i$$$). It is guaranteed that given graph is a tree.OutputIn the first line print one integer $$$res$$$ — the maximum number of edges which belong to at least one of the simple paths between $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$, or $$$a$$$ and $$$c$$$.In the second line print three integers $$$a, b, c$$$ such that $$$1 \le a, b, c \le n$$$ and $$$a \ne, b \ne c, a \ne c$$$.If there are several answers, you can print any     dfs and similar      dp      greedy      trees      *2000
