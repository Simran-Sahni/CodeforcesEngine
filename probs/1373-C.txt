C. Pluses and Minusestime 2  256 You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters + and -. You perform some process with this string. This process can be described by the following pseudocode: res = 0for init = 0 to inf    cur = init    ok = true    for i = 1 to |s|        res = res + 1        if s[i] == '+'            cur = cur + 1        else            cur = cur - 1        if cur < 0            ok = false            break    if ok        breakNote that the $$$inf$$$ denotes infinity, and the characters of the string are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$|s|$$$.You have to calculate the value of the $$$res$$$ after the process ends.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The only lines of each test case contains string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le 10^6$$$) consisting only of characters + and -.It's guaranteed that sum of $$$|s|$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case print one integer — the value of the $$$res$$$ after the process ends     math      *1300
