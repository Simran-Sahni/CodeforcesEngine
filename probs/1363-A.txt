A. Odd Selectiontime 1 secondmemory 256 Shubham has an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$, and wants to select exactly $$$x$$$ elements from it, such that their sum is odd. These elements do not have to be consecutive. The elements of the array are not guaranteed to be distinct.Tell him whether he can do so.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1\le t \le 100)$$$ — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ $$$(1 \le x \le n \le 1000)$$$ — the length of the array and the number of elements you need to choose.The next line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \le a_i \le 1000)$$$ — elements of the array.OutputFor each test case, print "Yes" or "No" depending on whether it is possible to choose $$$x$$$ elements such that their sum is odd.You may print every letter in any case you want     brute force      implementation      math      *1200
