E. Bombstime 3  256 You are given a permutation, $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$.Imagine that some positions of the permutation contain bombs, such that there exists at least one position without a bomb.For some fixed configuration of bombs, consider the following process. Initially, there is an empty set, $$$A$$$.For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$: Add $$$p_i$$$ to $$$A$$$.  If the $$$i$$$-th position contains a bomb, remove the largest element in $$$A$$$.After the process is completed, $$$A$$$ will be non-empty. The cost of the configuration of bombs equals the largest element in $$$A$$$.You are given another permutation, $$$q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n$$$.For each $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$, find the cost of a configuration of bombs such that there exists a bomb in positions $$$q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_{i-1}$$$. For example, for $$$i=1$$$, you need to find the cost of a configuration without bombs, and for $$$i=n$$$, you need to find the cost of a configuration with bombs in positions $$$q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_{n-1}$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer, $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 300\,000$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq p_i \leq n)$$$.The third line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq q_i \leq n)$$$.OutputPrint $$$n$$$ space-separated integers, such that the $$$i$$$-th of them equals the cost of a configuration of bombs in positions $$$q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_{i-1}$$$.     data structures      two pointers      *2400
