B. Irreducible Anagramstime 2  256 Let's call two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ anagrams of each other if it is possible to rearrange symbols in the string $$$s$$$ to get a string, equal to $$$t$$$.Let's consider two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ which are anagrams of each other. We say that $$$t$$$ is a reducible anagram of $$$s$$$ if there exists an integer $$$k \ge 2$$$ and $$$2k$$$ non-empty strings $$$s_1, t_1, s_2, t_2, \dots, s_k, t_k$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  If we write the strings $$$s_1, s_2, \dots, s_k$$$ in order, the resulting string will be equal to $$$s$$$;  If we write the strings $$$t_1, t_2, \dots, t_k$$$ in order, the resulting string will be equal to $$$t$$$;  For all integers $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$k$$$ inclusive, $$$s_i$$$ and $$$t_i$$$ are anagrams of each other. If such strings don't exist, then $$$t$$$ is said to be an irreducible anagram of $$$s$$$. Note that these notions are only defined when $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ are anagrams of each other.For example, consider the string $$$s = $$$ "gamegame". Then the string $$$t = $$$ "megamage" is a reducible anagram of $$$s$$$, we may choose for example $$$s_1 = $$$ "game", $$$s_2 = $$$ "gam", $$$s_3 = $$$ "e" and $$$t_1 = $$$ "mega", $$$t_2 = $$$ "mag", $$$t_3 = $$$ "e":  On the other hand, we can prove that $$$t = $$$ "memegaga" is an irreducible anagram of $$$s$$$.You will be given a string $$$s$$$ and $$$q$$$ queries, represented by two integers $$$1 \le l \le r \le |s|$$$ (where $$$|s|$$$ is equal to the length of the string $$$s$$$). For each query, you should find if the substring of $$$s$$$ formed by characters from the $$$l$$$-th to the $$$r$$$-th has at least one irreducible anagram.InputThe first line contains a string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase English characters ($$$1 \le |s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 10^5$$$)  — the number of queries.Each of the following $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le |s|$$$), representing a query for the substring of $$$s$$$ formed by characters from the $$$l$$$-th to the $$$r$$$-th.OutputFor each query, print a single line containing "Yes" (without quotes) if the corresponding substring has at least one irreducible anagram, and a single line containing "No" (without quotes) otherwise.     binary search      constructive algorithms      data structures      strings      two pointers      *1800
