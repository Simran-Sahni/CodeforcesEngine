A. Ichihime and Triangletime 1 secondmemory 256 Ichihime is the current priestess of the Mahjong Soul Temple. She claims to be human, despite her cat ears.These days the temple is holding a math contest. Usually, Ichihime lacks interest in these things, but this time the prize for the winner is her favorite — cookies. Ichihime decides to attend the contest. Now she is solving the following problem. You are given four positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$d$$$, such that $$$a \leq b \leq c \leq d$$$. Your task is to find three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, $$$z$$$, satisfying the following conditions: $$$a \leq x \leq b$$$. $$$b \leq y \leq c$$$. $$$c \leq z \leq d$$$. There exists a triangle with a positive non-zero area and the lengths of its three sides are $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$.Ichihime desires to get the cookie, but the problem seems too hard for her. Can you help her?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$)  — the number of test cases.The next $$$t$$$ lines describe test cases. Each test case is given as four space-separated integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \leq a \leq b \leq c \leq d \leq 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, $$$z$$$  — the integers you found satisfying the conditions given in the statement.It is guaranteed that the answer always exists. If there are multiple answers, print any     constructive algorithms      math      *800
