A. Candies and Two Sisterstime 1 secondmemory 256 There are two sisters Alice and Betty. You have $$$n$$$ candies. You want to distribute these $$$n$$$ candies between two sisters in such a way that:  Alice will get $$$a$$$ ($$$a > 0$$$) candies;  Betty will get $$$b$$$ ($$$b > 0$$$) candies;  each sister will get some integer number of candies;  Alice will get a greater amount of candies than Betty (i.e. $$$a > b$$$);  all the candies will be given to one of two sisters (i.e. $$$a+b=n$$$). Your task is to calculate the number of ways to distribute exactly $$$n$$$ candies between sisters in a way described above. Candies are indistinguishable.Formally, find the number of ways to represent $$$n$$$ as the sum of $$$n=a+b$$$, where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are positive integers and $$$a>b$$$.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The only line of a test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^9$$$) — the number of candies you have.OutputFor each test case, print the answer — the number of ways to distribute exactly $$$n$$$ candies between two sisters in a way described in the problem statement. If there is no way to satisfy all the conditions, print $$$0$$$     math      *800
