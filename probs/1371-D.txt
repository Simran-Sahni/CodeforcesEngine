D. Grid-00100time 1 secondmemory 256 A mad scientist Dr.Jubal has made a competitive programming task. Try to solve it!You are given integers $$$n,k$$$. Construct a grid $$$A$$$ with size $$$n \times n$$$ consisting of integers $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$. The very important condition should be satisfied: the sum of all elements in the grid is exactly $$$k$$$. In other words, the number of $$$1$$$ in the grid is equal to $$$k$$$.Let's define:  $$$A_{i,j}$$$ as the integer in the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column.  $$$R_i = A_{i,1}+A_{i,2}+...+A_{i,n}$$$ (for all $$$1 \le i \le n$$$).  $$$C_j = A_{1,j}+A_{2,j}+...+A_{n,j}$$$ (for all $$$1 \le j \le n$$$).  In other words, $$$R_i$$$ are row sums and $$$C_j$$$ are column sums of the grid $$$A$$$.  For the grid $$$A$$$ let's define the value $$$f(A) = (\max(R)-\min(R))^2 + (\max(C)-\min(C))^2$$$ (here for an integer sequence $$$X$$$ we define $$$\max(X)$$$ as the maximum value in $$$X$$$ and $$$\min(X)$$$ as the minimum value in $$$X$$$). Find any grid $$$A$$$, which satisfies the following condition. Among such grids find any, for which the value $$$f(A)$$$ is the minimum possible. Among such tables, you can find any.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Next $$$t$$$ lines contain descriptions of test cases.For each test case the only line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ $$$(1 \le n \le 300, 0 \le k \le n^2)$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, firstly print the minimum possible value of $$$f(A)$$$ among all tables, for which the condition is satisfied.After that, print $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$n$$$ characters each. The $$$j$$$-th character in the $$$i$$$-th line should be equal to $$$A_{i,j}$$$.If there are multiple answers you can print any     constructive algorithms      greedy      implementation      *1600
