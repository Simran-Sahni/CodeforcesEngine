E. Spaceship Solitairetime 1 secondmemory 256 Bob is playing a game of Spaceship Solitaire. The goal of this game is to build a spaceship. In order to do this, he first needs to accumulate enough resources for the construction. There are $$$n$$$ types of resources, numbered $$$1$$$ through $$$n$$$. Bob needs at least $$$a_i$$$ pieces of the $$$i$$$-th resource to build the spaceship. The number $$$a_i$$$ is called the goal for resource $$$i$$$.Each resource takes $$$1$$$ turn to produce and in each turn only one resource can be produced. However, there are certain milestones that speed up production. Every milestone is a triple $$$(s_j, t_j, u_j)$$$, meaning that as soon as Bob has $$$t_j$$$ units of the resource $$$s_j$$$, he receives one unit of the resource $$$u_j$$$ for free, without him needing to spend a turn. It is possible that getting this free resource allows Bob to claim reward for another milestone. This way, he can obtain a large number of resources in a single turn.The game is constructed in such a way that there are never two milestones that have the same $$$s_j$$$ and $$$t_j$$$, that is, the award for reaching $$$t_j$$$ units of resource $$$s_j$$$ is at most one additional resource.A bonus is never awarded for $$$0$$$ of any resource, neither for reaching the goal $$$a_i$$$ nor for going past the goal — formally, for every milestone $$$0 < t_j < a_{s_j}$$$.A bonus for reaching certain amount of a resource can be the resource itself, that is, $$$s_j = u_j$$$.Initially there are no milestones. You are to process $$$q$$$ updates, each of which adds, removes or modifies a milestone. After every update, output the minimum number of turns needed to finish the game, that is, to accumulate at least $$$a_i$$$ of $$$i$$$-th resource for each $$$i \in [1, n]$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of types of resources.The second line contains $$$n$$$ space separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$), the $$$i$$$-th of which is the goal for the $$$i$$$-th resource.The third line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq q \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of updates to the game milestones.Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, the $$$j$$$-th of which contains three space separated integers $$$s_j$$$, $$$t_j$$$, $$$u_j$$$ ($$$1 \leq s_j \leq n$$$, $$$1 \leq t_j < a_{s_j}$$$, $$$0 \leq u_j \leq n$$$). For each triple, perform the following actions:   First, if there is already a milestone for obtaining $$$t_j$$$ units of resource $$$s_j$$$, it is removed.  If $$$u_j = 0$$$, no new milestone is added.  If $$$u_j \neq 0$$$, add the following milestone: "For reaching $$$t_j$$$ units of resource $$$s_j$$$, gain one free piece of $$$u_j$$$."  Output the minimum number of turns needed to win the game.
