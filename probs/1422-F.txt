F. Boring Queriestime 3  512 Yura owns a quite ordinary and boring array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You think there is nothing more boring than that, but Vladik doesn't agree!In order to make Yura's array even more boring, Vladik makes $$$q$$$ boring queries. Each query consists of two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. Before answering a query, the bounds $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ for this query are calculated: $$$l = (last + x) \bmod n + 1$$$, $$$r = (last + y) \bmod n + 1$$$, where $$$last$$$ is the answer on the previous query (zero initially), and $$$\bmod$$$ is the remainder operation. Whenever $$$l > r$$$, they are swapped.After Vladik computes $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ for a query, he is to compute the least common multiple (LCM) on the segment $$$[l; r]$$$ of the initial array $$$a$$$ modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$. LCM of a multiset of integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all the elements of the multiset. The obtained LCM is the answer for this query.Help Vladik and compute the answer for each query!InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the elements of the array.The third line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 10^5$$$) — the number of queries.The next $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ each ($$$1 \le x, y \le n$$$) — the description of the corresponding query.OutputPrint $$$q$$$ integers — the answers for the queries     data structures      math      number theory      *2700
