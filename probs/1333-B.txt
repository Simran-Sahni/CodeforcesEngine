B. Kind Antontime 1 secondmemory 256 Once again, Boris needs the help of Anton in creating a task. This time Anton needs to solve the following problem:There are two arrays of integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It turned out that array $$$a$$$ contains only elements from the set $$$\{-1, 0, 1\}$$$.Anton can perform the following sequence of operations any number of times:  Choose any pair of indexes $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$1 \le i < j \le n$$$. It is possible to choose the same pair $$$(i, j)$$$ more than once.   Add $$$a_i$$$ to $$$a_j$$$. In other words, $$$j$$$-th element of the array becomes equal to $$$a_i + a_j$$$. For example, if you are given array $$$[1, -1, 0]$$$, you can transform it only to $$$[1, -1, -1]$$$, $$$[1, 0, 0]$$$ and $$$[1, -1, 1]$$$ by one operation.Anton wants to predict if it is possible to apply some number (zero or more) of these operations to the array $$$a$$$ so that it becomes equal to array $$$b$$$. Can you help him?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$)  — the length of arrays.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-1 \le a_i \le 1$$$)  — elements of array $$$a$$$. There can be duplicates among elements.The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le b_i \le 10^9$$$)  — elements of array $$$b$$$. There can be duplicates among elements.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output one line containing "YES" if it's possible to make arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ equal by performing the described operations, or "NO" if it's impossible.You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower)     greedy      implementation      *1100
