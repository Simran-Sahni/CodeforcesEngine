E. Clear the Multisettime 2  256 You have a multiset containing several integers. Initially, it contains $$$a_1$$$ elements equal to $$$1$$$, $$$a_2$$$ elements equal to $$$2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ elements equal to $$$n$$$.You may apply two types of operations:  choose two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$l \le r$$$), then remove one occurrence of $$$l$$$, one occurrence of $$$l + 1$$$, ..., one occurrence of $$$r$$$ from the multiset. This operation can be applied only if each number from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ occurs at least once in the multiset;  choose two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$x \ge 1$$$), then remove $$$x$$$ occurrences of $$$i$$$ from the multiset. This operation can be applied only if the multiset contains at least $$$x$$$ occurrences of $$$i$$$. What is the minimum number of operations required to delete all elements from the multiset?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5000$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).OutputPrint one integer â€” the minimum number of operations required to delete all elements from the multiset.     data structures      divide and conquer      dp      greedy      *2200
